oPPorTuniTies 
for Baking 
and PasTry 
Professionals

Baking originated thousands of years ago and it is integral to human 
history and still is the source of the most basic foodstuffs. Bread’s 
importance can be seen in the way governments regulated its 
production, quality, weight, and price. Bakers established the first trade 
guilds in Rome in 150 b.c.e.

The pastry chef, as the position exists today, evolved through the 
brigade system. Instituted by Escoffier, it served to streamline work 
with workstation and specific responsibilities. Pastries were made by the 
pâtissier (pastry chef). Later, this position separated from the brigade 
and developed its own organization largely attributed to Marie-Antoine 
Carême (1784–1833), a Parisian chef and pastry chef whose books on 
the pastry arts are influential to this day.

Choosing ingredients with care based upon quality, seasonality, and 
other considerations, including cost, is a prerequisite for high-quality 
baked goods. Each ingredient has its own set of characteristics, and it 
is the pastry chef’s or baker’s job to know how to handle all ingredients 
properly from the time they are received throughout each phase of 
storage, handling, and preparation.

The WheaT Kernel

Before the baker can understand the different vari-
eties of wheat flour, he or she must understand 
what makes up wheat. The wheat kernel is made up 
of the following components:

Bran constitutes 14.5 percent of total kernel 
weight. The bran is the dark outer coating of the 
wheat kernel and contains large amounts of insolu-
ble dietary fiber.

endosperm comprises 83 percent of total kernel 
weight. The endosperm is the internal portion of 
the wheat kernel and contains the largest amount 
of protein and starch. White flour is produced from 
the endosperm.

Germ is 2.5 percent of total kernel weight. The 
germ is the embryo of the wheat kernel and con-
tains fats, vitamins, minerals, and some protein.

Wheat is classified by season and color, as 
follows: hard red winter wheat, hard white winter 
wheat, hard red spring wheat, soft red winter wheat, 
and soft white winter wheat. (Durum wheat is a par-
ticular type of hard wheat.) Winter wheat is planted

Just as an artist learns to master all the instruments necessary for 
painting, sculpting, or drawing, bakers and pastry chefs learn to master 
a variety of small tools and large equipment. These devices are as 
important as your own fingers—quite literally an extension of your 
hands. Tools and equipment of all sorts represent one of the biggest 
investments in the bakeshop or kitchen.

The importance of storing and preparing food properly cannot be 
overemphasized. In addition to the precautions necessary to guard 
against food-borne illness, care must also be taken to avoid accidents 
involving staff or guests. Practicing and monitoring safe procedures will 
keep both your employees and customers safe from food-borne illness 
and injury.

6  Baking  
  Formulas  
  and Bakers’  
  Percentages

A baker or pastry chef needs to perform a number of key calculations in 
order to have consistently successful results and work efficiently. This 
chapter provides a brief overview of some of the basic mathematical 
formulas and calculations used in the bakeshop and pastry kitchen 
to create standardized production formulas, increase or decrease a 
formula’s yield (a technique known as scaling), and adjust to different 
production needs.

standards, count can be a useful, accurate way to mea-
sure that ingredient. It is less accurate for ingredients 
requiring some preparation before they are added to 
the formula or for those without any established stan-
dards for purchasing. Apples illustrate the point well. If 
a formula calls for ten apples, then the yield, flavor, and 
consistency of the item will change depending upon 
whether the apples you use are large or small. 

Volume is a measurement of the space occupied 
by a solid, liquid, or gas. The terms teaspoon (tsp), table-
spoon (tbsp), fluid ounce (fl oz), cup, pint (pt), quart (qt), 
gallon (gal), milliliter (mL), and liter (L) all indicate units 
of volume measure. Graduated containers (measur-
ing cups) and utensils with a precise volume (such as a 
2-ounce ladle or a teaspoon) are used to measure vol-
ume. Volume measurements are best suited to liquids, 
though they are also used for dry ingredients, such 
as spices, in small amounts. Keep in mind that tools 
used for measuring volume are not always as precise 
as they should be. Volume measuring tools need not 
conform to any regulated standards, so the amount of 
an ingredient measured with one set of spoons, cups, 
or pitchers could be quite different from the amount 
measured with another set. (To learn more about con-
verting volume measures to weight measures, see the 
table in “Converting to a Common Unit of Measure,” 
page 94.)

Weight is a measurement of the mass or heavi-
ness of a solid, liquid, or gas. The terms ounce (oz), 
pound (lb), gram (g), and kilogram (kg) all indicate 
units of weight measure. Scales are used to measure

leaveners.

Desired yield
= Formula conversion factor (FCF)

Original yield

The desired yield and the original yield must be 
expressed in the same way before you can use the 
formula; that is, both must be in the same unit of 
measure. For example, if the original formula gives 
the yield in ounces and you want to make 2 quarts 
of the sauce, you will need to convert quarts into 
fluid ounces. Or, if your original formula says that 
it makes five servings and does not list the size of 
each serving, you may need to test the formula to 
determine the serving size.

To convert measurements to a common unit (by

This information can be used both to convert scaled 
measurements into practical and easy-to-use for-

conversion charts, see Appendix C: Conversions,

CalCulating Water calculating DDT 
First, calculate the TTF. (desired dough 

temperature from ddt temperature).
DDT × TTF factor = TTF

To calculate the DDT, you must first determine the 80 × 3 = 240
following: the total temperature factor (TTF) and 
the sum of the other known temperatures that will 
influence the DDT. All of these numbers are used to 
calculate the temperature that the water should be 
when it is added to the ingredients so that after mix-
ing the dough will be at or very near the DDT.

To make this calculation, first calculate the TTF. 
To find the TTF, multiply the DDT by the number of 
temperature factors to be considered. For a straight 
mix dough, there are typically three factors to be con-
sidered. For a sourdough, enriched dough, or a dough 
that uses a pre-ferment, there are four or sometimes 
five factors, depending on the number of elements 
that are going to be added to the dough. These ele-
ments include the temperatures of the flour, soaker, 
pre-ferment, butter, eggs, and any ingredient that is 
over 20 percent. Also to be factored in are the ambient 
temperature and the friction created by the mixer.

After you have found the TTF, subtract the sum 
of the known temperatures from it to give the ideal 
temperature for the water. The known tempera-
tures are the temperature of the flour, preferments, 
eggs, any other ingredient over 20%, and the room. 
You also need to know the amount of friction the 
dough will undergo in the mixer. This is known as 
the  friction factor.

To calculate the friction factor, you will need 
to take the temperature of the dough as soon as it 
becomes homogeneous in the mixer. Typically, this is

First subtract the actual water temperature For example, if the calculated water tempera-

ice to use, an “ice Btu factor” (the number of British 
thermal units it takes to melt 1 pound of ice) must be 
used in the following equation:

(Total weight of water) × (Water temperature − Desired water temperature)
= Weight of ice

The result is the number of pounds of ice In this formula, you will need to reduce the

When flour, water, yeast, and salt are worked together in the correct 
proportions for the appropriate amount of time and at the right 
temperature, proper gluten structure develops. The bread baker knows 
that the ingredients play a key role in the quality of the dough, as do the 
mixing and fermentation methods. The techniques in this chapter take 
the bread-baking process up through a finished dough.

RetaRding dough
Retarding dough means to purposely cool the 
dough, typically at temperatures of around 
40°F/4°C, in order to slow the fermentation pro-
cess. Retarding permits bakers to organize their 
work to meet production and employee sched-
ules. It also allows the gluten to relax further, 
since the fermentation is prolonged. This results 
in dough that is easier to shape. A prolonged fer-
mentation also gives dough time to develop a 
more pronounced sour flavor, so retarding dough

During baking, carbon dioxide and steam are

the bread. The gluten strands (and eggs, if used) 
stretch and coagulate to develop the internal struc-

Once the loaves are baked, it is important 
that they be cooled properly in order to preserve 
the crust and structure of the bread, as well as to 
allow for final development of flavor. All breads, 
but especially those made with lean doughs, should 
be cooled on wire racks to maintain air circulation

The way in which yeast is introduced into the dough—by either direct 
or indirect fermentation—gives the bread baker the range of techniques 
necessary to create simple lean dough quickly and efficiently and to 
create hearty breads using such indirect fermentation methods as 
sponges, poolishes, bigas, and sourdoughs. This chapter examines these 
more complex methods and presents numerous examples of their use in 
popular baked goods.

  doughs and  
  Batters

Pastry doughs are the foundation for a wide range of preparations. 
Pie dough, short dough, and puff pastry are only a few examples. All 
are made from the same basic ingredients, but different preparation 
techniques give them vastly different characteristics, making each 
suitable for different applications. Pastry batters such as crêpe batter 
or pâte à choux also serve as elemental preparations and are used in 
countless classical and contemporary desserts.

storage oF laminated dough
To prepare puff pasTry and other laminated doughs 
for freezing, and to ease their use when frozen, 
 follow this simple procedure: Roll the dough approx-
imately ¼ in/0.6 cm thick for efficiency’s sake. If 
 necessary, cut the dough into smaller sheets the size 
of a sheet pan or half sheet pan Layer the sheets 
on a sheet pan, placing a sheet of parchment paper 
between each one. Wrap the pan tightly in plastic

for refrigerated storage.)

As you cut puff pastry, you may create scraps, 
or trim. They can be reserved to be rerolled and 
used in pastries where a dramatic high, straight 
rise is not critical. Recommendations for the use of 
these scraps are the same as for blitz puff pastry; 
they should not be used for items that require a high 
and even rise. Layer the scraps on top of each other, 
keeping them flat to preserve the layers of fat and 
dough. Then the dough may be rolled and stored 
under refrigeration or frozen.

Finished puff 
pastry will have 
many layers of 

dough and butter.

10 Quick Breads  
  and cakes

Quick breads and cakes are served as breakfast pastries or simple 
desserts. They are also “foundation preparations” used for assembled 
cakes and tortes, including wedding and other special-occasion cakes. 
The pastry chef uses seven basic mixing methods—blending; creaming; 
two-stage; cold, warm, and separated foaming; and combination—to 
prepare all of these.

the eggs creates a light and airy batter and helps 
to leaven the final baked item. The air trapped in 
the eggs will form pockets that, during baking, will 
expand and cause the product to rise.

Egg foams are very delicate, so it is important 
that all ingredients and equipment be assembled and 
receive any preliminary treatment before you begin 
to mix the ingredients; this will help to assure that 
the foaming process proceeds as quickly as possible, 
thus preventing any loss of volume in the batter.

Flour and any other dry ingredients should 
be sifted thoroughly to ensure full aeration. Butter 
should be melted and allowed to cool slightly.

11  Cookies

The word cookie derives from a Dutch word that means “small cake.” 
Using this as the contemporary definition, cookies can include anything 
from the classic chocolate chunk to the twice-baked biscotti to glazed 
and filigreed petits fours. Each type of cookie requires different shaping 
techniques such as rolling, stamping, and molding. Many are filled, 
glazed, or otherwise finished after baking.

sheet before cutting it, and dip the knife in warm 
water and wipe it clean before each cut.

second time

Dough is prepareD in a log or loaf and baked one 
time. It is allowed to cool briefly, then sliced and 
rebaked to create a crisp cookie.

1.  Prepare the dough as directed.

2.  Pipe the dough or form it into logs or loaves.

3.  Bake until the internal structure is set but the 
color is not fully developed.

4.  The logs are generally allowed to cool briefly 
but not completely, so that they won’t be too brittle 
when sliced. Slice the cookies using a serrated blade. 
A serrated blade is less likely to chip and fray the 
edges of the cookies as they are sliced.

5.  Arrange the sliced cookies on sheet pans.

6.  Bake the cookies again, at a lower tempera-
ture. This will dry them fully and develop more fla-
vor and color; any seeds and nuts will toast at this 
point and the sugars in the dough will caramelize.

7.  Cool and store. Twice-baked cookies have 
a long shelf life due to the lack of moisture that 
results from being dried in the oven during the sec-
ond baking.

Creams, 
mousses, and 
soufflés

When the pastry chef combines eggs, milk, and sugar and bakes them, 
the result may be a smooth and creamy crème brûlée or a silky crème 
caramel. When these same ingredients are stirred together over gentle 
heat, vanilla sauce, or crème anglaise, is the result. Starches or gelatin 
can be included to produce textures that range from thick but spoonable 
to a sliceable cream. Folding in meringue or whipped cream produces 
mousse, Bavarian cream, diplomat cream, chibouste, or a soufflé. 
Custards can also be frozen to make ice creams.

3.  Beat the meringue to soft peaks. It is impor-

been folded into the base until evenly mixed, the 
batter should have a consistency similar to that of

13  IcIngs, glazes, 
and sauces

The use of an icing, glaze, or sauce can mean the difference between 
a plain baked item and a more elaborate pastry or dessert. These 
preparations have a wide range of uses, limited only by the imagination 
of the pastry chef or baker. The techniques and applications involved in 
making and using them are important to master, as they act to balance 
and adjust flavors and textures, making them an integral part of any 
pastry or dessert with which they are paired.

A small amount of an acid (cream of tartar, lemon

impurities such as flour or other ingredients. Whip 
the egg whites on high speed until they are frothy, 
then gradually add the sugar while continuing to 
whip to the desired consistency (soft, medium,

they become dry and lumpy, making them diffi-

fondanT
Fondant iS the traditional glaze for petits fours, 
éclairs, and doughnuts, among other pastries. Most 
kitchens and bakeshops use purchased fondant. 
For fondant to have its characteristic glossy fin-
ish, it must be warmed until it is liquid enough to 
flow readily (105°F/41°C). Small items are typically 
dipped into the fondant, using a dipping fork or 
similar tool. Larger items are set on racks on sheet 
pans and the fondant is poured, ladled, spooned, or 
drizzled over them.

Assemble all your equipment before beginning 
and keep the fondant warm as you work. 

1. Place fondant in a stainless-steel bowl and 
place over a hot water bath to heat. Do not let 
fondant exceed 105°F/41°C. Heating fondant 
reduces it to the liquid state needed to achieve 
the product’s characteristically glossy finish. 
Fondant should be warmed until it is able to flow 
readily.

2.  Thin the fondant to the desired consistency 
with warm water, corn syrup, or another liquid such 
as liqueur.

3.  If desired, color or flavor the fondant. Once 
it has been melted, plain fondant can be colored 
and flavored as desired by adding coloring pastes, 
purées, concentrates, or chocolate. To make choco-

As sabayon is a very rich sauce, it is tradition-
ally served with fresh fruit, berries, or other lean or 
acidic ingredients. It can be flavored as desired. If 
chocolate is added, the sauce will lose some of its 
airiness; the melted chocolate should be stirred in at 
the very end of the cooking process.

1. Combine egg yolks, sugar, and liquor in the 
bowl of a mixer and whip together until thoroughly 
blended. Examples of liquor or wine flavorings used 
in sabayon include Marsala, Champagne, bourbon, 
framboise, and Calvados.

2.  Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water 
and heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture 
is thickened and very foamy and has reached 
180°F/82°C. The yolks are whipped constantly as 
they cook over simmering water so a dense, thick 
foam develops. The mixture should be whipped vig-
orously. Whipping the mixture serves to incorpo-
rate air, developing the foam. Heating the mixture 
as it is whipped serves a dual purpose. It stabilizes 
the foam so that the volume is retained and also 
cooks the eggs sufficiently to make them safe for 
consumption. A properly thickened sabayon “rib-
bons” off the whisk.

from unsweetened or bittersweet chocolate or a 
combination of the two. To get the most intense fla-
vor, add a measure of cocoa powder, but be sure to 
adjust the sauce’s flavor and sweetness with sugar.

1. Combine sugar, water, and corn syrup in a 
heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil over 
medium-high heat. Remove from the heat.

2.  Place cocoa powder in a bowl and add enough 
of the hot sugar syrup to make a paste, stirring until

14  Frozen 
Desserts 

Sugar syrups, dairy and custard mixtures, yogurt, and fruit purées 
may all be used as the base to make frozen desserts. Any of these bases 
may then be churned- or still-frozen. These two methods of production 
yield frozen desserts with vastly different textures. Understanding 
the principles of each type of frozen dessert will give the chef creative 
freedom to explore different possibilities of flavor, texture, and 
presentation.

are not lined with cake, the molded dessert is often

15  Pies, TArTs, And 
FruiT desserTs

Desserts and pastries such as pies, tarts, strudel, and cobblers give the 
pastry chef or baker the opportunity to showcase the natural, vibrant 
flavors of fruits and nuts as well as the sweetness and texture of 
cheeses and dairy products used to make creams and custards. When 
creating desserts of this type, think of what spices and preparation 
techniques will enhance and complement the textures, shapes, and 
flavors of these ingredients.

4. Return the pan to the oven and bake the crust 
until the desired color is achieved. If the crust is to 
be baked again with a filling, bake it just until light 
golden brown. For a fully baked crust, bake to a 
deep golden brown, about 20 minutes. Pastry shells 
are partially prebaked when the time required to 
bake the filling will not be long enough to fully bake 
the crust. Shells are completely prebaked when 
they are to be filled with a filling that does not 
require further cooking or baking.

Working WiTh PuFF PAsTry
When Working WiTh puff pastry, keep it as cold as 
possible. Work in manageable batches so that the 
dough won’t sit at room temperature for too long. 
If the butter is allowed to soften, it will cause the 
layering to collapse and prevent the full rise of the 
dough.

Lightly dust the work surface with flour (prefer-
ably bread flour) to prevent the dough from sticking. 
Roll the dough from the center out in all directions, 
lifting and turning the dough as you work to prevent 
the gluten from being overworked in any one direc-
tion. Uneven rolling will cause the pastry to become 
misshapen during baking.

When using puff pastry to line a tart pan, it 
should be rolled very thin and docked well to inhibit 
excessive rising during baking. When blind baking 
puff pastry for items such as napoleons, it should 
be weighted down to prevent it from fully rising. If 
allowed to fully rise, it would be too flaky to cut into 
smaller portions or for building pastries.

Puff pastry is always baked at a relatively 
high temperature (400° to 425°F/204° to 218°C) 
to encourage the full rise. Lower temperatures 
would not create enough steam or set the struc-
ture of the pastry quickly enough, and it would 
either never rise or collapse. Puff dough is docked 

before baking to prevent 
too high a rise.

Cakes and 
TorTes

When selecting components to build a cake or torte, it is important to 
consider the combination of flavors and textures. Classic cakes and 
tortes are fine examples of flavor combinations and appealing designs 
and offer a foundation of inspiration for contemporary applications. 
Contemporary cakes and tortes explore new flavor combinations 
generated from the globalization of cuisine and culture.

cake.

1.  Cakes should be allowed to cool completely 
before cutting into layers. Cut the cakes into lay-
ers between ¼ and ½ in/0.6 cm and 1 cm thick. 
Typically, thinner layers will make a better cake than 
thicker layers. Fillings that are spread onto layers 
should generally be less than ½ in/1 cm thick and 
should not exceed the thickness of the cake layers. 
However, poured fillings such as Bavarian cream 
can be applied in layers thicker than the cake lay-
ers, as they are usually less rich and have a lighter 
texture than spread fillings.

2.  Before slicing a cake into layers, trim any uneven 
areas from the sides and top. For the best results, use 
a cake-decorating turntable and a knife with a long, 
thin serrated blade. Set the cake on a cardboard cake 
round and then on the turntable. First divide the cake 
by eye into the desired number of layers. Then insert 
the knife into the side of the cake at the appropri-
ate level and, holding the knife steady and level and 
slowly rotating the turntable, move the blade of the 
knife into the cake to cut the layer. Remove the layer 
and set aside; repeat as necessary.

Functions oF garnish 

The garnish For iTems in a bakery or pastry shop 
serves several important functions, one of which is adding The final garnish on

visual appeal. although a perfectly iced or glazed but other- illustrate the flavors 
wise unadorned cake can be a thing of beauty, it requires more contained within or to add

gives bakers or pastry chefs a chance to display their skill. They 
can use their imagination, creativity, and knowledge to garnish 
cakes and pastries, using techniques and ingredients in unique 
combinations to make items look enticing and exciting.

garnish can also be used to indicate the flavors and 
ingredients in the cake or pastry item. This serves the cus-
tomers, helping them make a selection by informing them of 
the flavors used in the cake or pastry. For example, a black 
Forest cake is a chocolate cake with a filling of cherries, and 
the typical garnish is chocolate shavings and whole pre-
served cherries.

Classic cakes, tortes, and pastries often have a specific, 
traditional way in which they have been garnished since 
their inception. The décor (garnish) of an item like this is 
always the same, serving both as a way to identify these items 
and as homage to the place or person responsible for the orig-
inal cake or pastry.

in garnishing a cake or torte, there are two basic approaches 
to the décor. The cake may be thought of as a whole, or it may 
be considered in terms of portions. decorating a cake with por-
tions in mind is an approach that developed in pastry shops 
where cakes are traditionally sold by the slice. decorating cakes 
as a whole is the preferred approach where cakes are sold as a 
whole piece.

seal coat is set. the flame of a propane torch over the surface. layer of glaze.

2.  Prepare a glazing setup by placing a wire rack 
on a sheet pan. The rack will allow the glaze to run 
freely from the sides of the cake, while the sheet 
pan will catch the excess glaze, which, if it does not 
contain any crumbs, can be rewarmed and used on 
another item. Have ready a straight or offset long 
metal spatula for spreading the glaze. Before you 
glaze, if you desire, reserve some of the glaze for 
the décor.

3.  Place the cake on the center of the wire rack. 
Check the consistency and temperature of the 
glaze. If it is too thick, rewarm it or, for glazes such 
as fondant, adjust the fluidity and temperature. 
The glaze should not be too warm, or it will not 
coat properly. It may run too much and could cause 
the seal coat to begin to melt, making it difficult to 
achieve the glossy look of a properly applied glaze. 
Be careful not to stir the glaze too much, as this will 
incorporate air and cause bubbles in the glaze on 
the surface of the cake.

4.  Pour enough glaze onto the center of the cake 
to enrobe it. Working quickly, spread the glaze over 
the entire top of the cake with three swipes of a long 
metal icing spatula, working across the top of the 
cake in one direction (always pushing or drawing the 
glaze away from you) from one side to the other and 
then off the cake. Do not lift the spatula while it is 
on the cake, or it will pull up the seal coat and cause 
crumbs to become mixed with the glaze, destroying 
the finish; pulling or drawing the spatula toward you 
can have the same effect. In addition to covering the 
top of the cake, this technique will cause the glaze 
to run down over the sides, covering them as well. 
Once the top of the cake is covered, use the spatula 
to spread glaze over any small portions of the sides 
of the cake that were not covered.

Pastries

pastries include everything from flaky croissants to crisp fruit-filled 
Danish to moist blueberry muffins.

PastrIes

Individual pastries, created from pastry doughs or batters with fillings, 
may be constructed as single portions or as a larger item, such as a 
cake, which is individually portioned and garnished. Individual pastries 
encompass a wide variety of baked goods, from very refined to rustic. 
Depending on the type of pastry, it may be appropriate for sale in a 
retail bakeshop, for service during breakfast or brunch, with coffee or 
tea, at receptions, or on a dessert menu.

tartlets
By scaling down the formulas for various pies and Prebaked tartlet shells should be left in the ring 
tarts, the pastry chef can prepare a number of molds while they are filled, to support them during 
individual pastries. Most of the tartlet formulas in assembly and until the filling sets.
this chapter (with the exception of those that are 
“free-form”) were developed using a 3-in/8-cm ring 
mold or tartlet pan, but the formulas can be easily 
adapted to suit molds of other sizes or shapes. The 
same basic principles used for preparing large pies 
and tarts apply to tartlets. They can be baked in a 
mold, or free-form as a galette. They may be made 
using short dough or puff pastry dough. Depending 
on the type of filling, the shells may be partially 
or completely prebaked. Typically, shells are com-
pletely prebaked unless otherwise specified. They 
may be filled with fresh or poached fruits, nuts, 
chocolate ganache, or custard. Fillings may be pre-
cooked and poured into a baked shell or baked with 
the crust. Many fillings contain components that 
combine techniques. For example, one component 
of a filling could be a frangipane filling, which would 
be baked with the crust; then jam could be added in 
a thin, even layer; finally, the tart might be finished 
with fresh berries or other fruit and topped with 
a glaze. Combining elements in this way gives the 
pastry chef freedom to explore different flavor and 
textural profiles to create unique desserts.

Phyllo dough
Phyllo dough is made only of flour and water (and Brushing layers of 
occasionally a small amount of oil). The dough is phyllo dough with 

butter
stretched and rolled until it is extremely thin, then 
cut into sheets. Much as in a laminated dough such 
as puff pastry, the sheets are layered to create many 
flaky layers of pastry that encase or hold a filling, 
which may be anything from fruit to a mousse or 
cream. But instead of being rolled into the dough 
as it is for laminated doughs, the butter is melted 
and brushed onto the dough sheets before they are 
baked, as is done with strudel.

Many bakeshops purchase frozen phyllo dough 
sheets. This dough must thaw and come to room 
temperature before it can be worked with. Phyllo 
dough can dry out quickly and become brittle 
enough to shatter, so after it is removed from its 
wrapping, it is important to cover it with dampened 
towels and plastic wrap. Use a pastry brush to apply 
the butter in an even coat and then, if desired, sprin-
kle with cake or bread crumbs to keep the layers 
separate as they bake.

PIPed PastrIes
a variety oF individual pastries can be made using 
meringue or pâte à choux. Both of these ele-
ments are shaped by piping, then baked and filled. 
Meringues can be piped into containers, filled, and 
served, or piped into disks and assembled like a 
sandwich. The fillings paired with meringue are usu-
ally high in fat to contrast with the lean flavor and 
crisp mouthfeel of the meringue.

Pâte à choux can be piped into oblongs for 
éclairs, into rings for Paris-Brest, into domes for 
cream puffs, or into more intricate shapes, such 
as the classic swan. After baking, a filling is piped 
into the pâte à choux either by slicing it open or by 
using a small pastry tip to puncture the shell and 
inject the filling. Pastries of this type are typically 
glazed or dusted with confectioners’ sugar to finish. 
It is important when preparing either type of shell 
(meringue or pâte à choux) that it be baked until 
dry and crisp and allowed to cool completely before 
filling.

Savory baking enables the pastry chef to deepen the professional 
repertoire. Execution of these products will broaden understanding of 
how savory baked goods can provide opportunities for lighter dining, 
creative amuse plates, and nourishing accompaniments to an informal 
gathering, cocktail reception, or large-scale catering event.

Chiffonade
The chiffonade cut is used for leafy vegetables and 
herbs. The result is a fine shred, often used as a gar-
nish or bed. Use a chef’s knife to make very fine, par-
allel cuts to produce fine shreds. 

For Belgian endive, remove the leaves from the 
core and stack them. Make parallel lengthwise cuts 
to produce a shred. 

For greens with large leaves, such as romaine, 
roll individual leaves into cylinders before cutting 
crosswise. Stack smaller leaves, such as basil, one on 
top of another, then roll them into cylinders and cut 
crosswise.

resulting from the juices and fats that are rendered 
as the food cooks, as well as from direct contact 
with the rods of the grill rack.

Broiling is similar to grilling but uses a heat 
source located above the food rather than below. 
Frequently, delicate foods like lean white fish are 
brushed with butter or oil, put on a heated, oiled siz-
zler platter, and then placed on the rack below the 
heat source instead of directly on the rods.

Tender portion-size cuts of poultry, cuts of 
meat from the loin, rib, or top round areas, and fil-
lets of fatty fish such as tuna and salmon are suited 
to grilling and broiling. Lean fish may also be grilled 
or broiled if they are coated with oil or an oil-based 
marinade. Some less-tender cuts of meat such as 
hanger or flank steak may also be used if they are 
cut very thin before or after cooking.

All meat and fish should be cut to an even 
thickness. When preparing meat for grilling or broil-
ing, pound meats and fish lightly if necessary to even 
their thickness. Meat should be trimmed of excess 
fat and all silverskin and gristle. Some foods are cut 
into strips, chunks, or cubes and then threaded onto 
skewers. The food itself should be seasoned and in 
some cases lightly oiled.

Different parts of the grill are hotter than oth-
ers. Divide the grill into zones of varying heat inten-
sity, including a very hot section for quickly searing 
foods and an area of moderate-to-low heat for slow 
cooking and holding foods. (if the grill is wood- or 
charcoal-fired, set aside an area for igniting the fuel, 
which may be too hot and smoky to cook foods over 
directly.)

Foods such as whole birds, chicken breasts, 
and chops may be stuffed before roasting. Season 
the stuffing and chill it to below 40°F/4°C before 
combining it with raw meat, fish, or poultry. Allow 
enough time for the seasonings to interact with the

the cavity of a bird before trussing, rub seasonings 
on the skin or slip them under the skin.

A good roasting pan has a flat bottom with 
relatively low sides to encourage hot air to circulate 
freely around the roasting food. Select a pan that 
holds the food comfortably but is not so large that 
the pan juices will scorch. Food to be roasted may 
be set on a roasting rack, which permits the hot air 
to contact all of the food’s surfaces, but good results

of vegetables, especially cucumbers. The end of a 
vegetable that was attached to the plant can con-
tain various enzymes which can affect the texture of 
the finished pickled product and/or lead to spoilage. 
In addition, be sure to use unwaxed produce—any 
produce with a wax coating will not properly pickle. 

Vegetables are not the only foods that can be 
successfully pickled— many varieties of fruit make 
delicious pickles. Choose firm, ripe (but not over-
ripe) fruits, as the pickling process will tenderize the 
flesh somewhat. You may want to pretreat the fruit

20  Plated desserts

When designing a plated dessert, the pastry chef must consider 
the composition, exploring the possibilities of contrasting and 
complementing flavors and textures as well as color and style. Equally 
important to consider are the customer base, the specific event or menu 
needs, and the environment for preparation and service.

21 ChoColates and 
ConfeCtions

This chapter introduces principles and techniques involved with working 
with chocolate and sugar. These techniques are used to make ganaches, 
gianduja, caramels, candied fruit, fondant, marzipan, and gelées, as 
well as aerated, molded, and deposited candies, chocolates, and other 
confections.

chocolate to be tempered—is added to the warm 
(110°F/43°C) melted chocolate and gently stirred 
to melt and incorporate it. The stable crystals in the

BloCk Method
1.  With the block method of chocolate temper-

to warm melted chocolate and gently stirred until 
the desired temperature is reached. The block of 
chocolate not only reduces the temperature of the 
melted chocolate, but also provides the seed crys-
tals necessary for tempering.

2.  After the chocolate is brought into temper, the 
seed, or block of chocolate, is removed. The block 
can be used again. This method is simple and effec-
tive, but slightly more time-consuming than other 
methods of tempering.

1.  Chop the chocolate into small pieces of uni-
form size so the pieces will melt quickly and at 
the same rate. Dark, milk, or white chocolate may 
be used to make cream ganache. Milk and white 
chocolate contain less cocoa solids and less cocoa 
butter than a dark variety and so require a higher 
recipe ratio of chocolate to cream. Percentages 
of cocoa solids or butter may also vary based on 
the chocolate manufacturer, so ratios should be 
adjusted as needed.

2.  Bring heavy cream to a boil in a heavy-bot-
tomed saucepan.

3.  Pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Let

allow it to melt.

2.  Add the remaining sugar in small increments, 
allowing each addition of sugar to fully melt before 
adding the next. Continue this process until all 
the sugar has been added to the pan. Cook to the 
desired color. Using this method, sugar crystals are 
melted through the application of heat, resulting in 
sugar that caramelizes almost as soon as it melts. 
Because it cooks so quickly, it is important to moni-

Of the two techniques for cooking sugar—wet 
and dry—only the wet method allows the sugar to be 
cooked to and used at the various stages that are vital 
for countless preparations. The dry method of sugar 
cooking is only used to make caramelized sugar.

22  Décor

Décor is the finishing touch given to any pastry or cake. The pastry chef 
employs a variety of techniques and materials to craft a look that not 
only displays creativity and skill but also sets his or her pastries, cakes, 
and other desserts apart.

with royal icing repeated on a cake or décor piece.
When making large or very intricate patterns, 

it is usually necessary to pipe more than one layer 
of royal icing. Pay close attention to any connect-
ing points or joints to ensure the finished piece will 
be strong enough to be lifted from the plastic and 
secured to the finished cake or other object. As 
you are planning the pattern of loops, keep in mind 
that loops that cross, intersect, or lie on top of one 
another result in greater stability of the sugar work.

Another technique often used with royal icing 
is called flood work. To do flood work or to make a 
run-out, an outline of a pattern or motif is piped onto 
acetate and allowed to dry until firm. Then thinned 
royal icing is used to fill in the interior of the pattern. 
This icing should be thin enough to fill in the design 
easily, with little extra manipulation or spreading 
necessary, minimizing the chance that any lines or 
imprints will be left in the finished piece. A good way 
to test the consistency of royal icing for flood work 
is to have the icing in a container, spoon some out, 
and allow it to drip back into the container. The drips 
going back into the container should disappear with-
out a trace at the count of ten.

2.  Thin the remaining royal icing with water until 
a small amount dropped back into the bowl from 
the tip of a spoon flattens back into the surface in 
10 seconds. Color the icing as desired.

3.  Fit a piping bag with a #2 plain tip. Fill the 
bag halfway with the royal icing. To fill the outlines 
with icing, begin at the edges of each one and work 
toward the center. At the edge of the shape, hold 
the tip a short distance away from the piped out-
line and allow the icing to flow toward the outline, 
creating a rounded edge. Continue piping, allowing 
each successive pass of icing to flow into the previ-
ous one, creating a smooth surface. 

4.  Place the shapes under a heat lamp or other 
heat source to dry. The more quickly the icing dries, 
the shinier the finish. 4.  Repeat the process, using care to produce

23  Wedding and 
Specialty 
cakeS

Wedding and specialty cakes are a culmination of the talent, skills, 
and knowledge of the pastry chef or baker. To make a beautiful and 
flavorful cake, the pastry chef or baker must hone his or her skills 
in almost all aspects of the baking and pastry arts. Creation and 
development of cakes such as the ones in this chapter are limited only by 
the creativity of the individual.

Prior to day 1: Design and produce decorations;

Day 1: Bake cake layers.

Day 2: Fill cake layers and seal-coat the cake.

Day 3: Ice and decorate cake.

Day 4: Transport cake and set it up.

This schedule is designed for lighter, freshly 
made cakes. Rich, dense British- or Australian-style 
cakes are often allowed to mature and ripen for 
weeks, meaning that the cake can be baked well 
ahead of time. For any cake, most of the time-con-
suming decorations can be made well in advance 
as long as there are adequate dry storage facilities.

Below are exact conversions to metric units of measure from U.S. units of measure. For the purposes 
of use in a professional kitchen, the metric measures in this book were rounded to the nearest 
10 grams, with the exception of those ingredients such as leaveners where rounding would have an 
adverse effect on the finished product.
Exact measurement conversion was used for the following: small weight and volume ingredients 
(under ½ ounce), chemical and natural leaveners, salts, spices, herbs, flavored oils and fats, extract 
liquids, and all hydrocolloids.
