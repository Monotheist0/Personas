                                Foreword

Although I have been modernized by life and my children, my roots are
Victorian. This book reflects my life. It was once merely a private
record of what the family wanted, of what friends recommended and of
dishes made familiar by foreign travel and given an acceptable
Americanization.

In the course of time there have been added to the rather weighty
stand-bys of my youth the ever-increasing lighter culinary touches of
the day. So the record, which to begin with was a collection such as
every kitchen-minded woman possesses, has grown in breadth and bulk
until it now covers a wide range.

This book is the result of a long practical experience, a lively
curiosity and a real love for cookery. In it I have made an attempt to
meet the needs of the average household, to make palatable dishes with
simple means and to lift everyday cooking out of the commonplace.

Written in a method so clear that a child can follow it, its
instructions cannot fail to help and inspire the novice. The experienced
cook will find in it innumerable practical and novel suggestions to spur
her on to new efforts.

Good cooks at home and abroad have contributed to this collection and
many a recipe is coupled in my mind with a grateful thought of the
friend who gave it.

Encouragement has come from many sources—especially from the eloping
bride who telegraphed her family: “Am married—order announcements—send
me a Rombauer cookbook at once”; from the man who interrupted a
conference to gaze at me fondly and say, “At last I can eat spinach”;
and from an unknown Cincinnati maid who stole her mistress’ copy of _The
Joy of Cooking_.

                      Preface to the 1943 Edition

At the request of my children, who were leaving home, I began a record
of “what Mother used to make.” They thought, correctly, that the work
involved would help me tide over a period of loneliness.

Ten years ago the first _Joy of Cooking_, a small volume published with
the help of a printer, was offered to an unknown public with some
trepidation on my part. It met with immediate success.

Three years later the Bobbs-Merrill Company brought out a much enlarged
and improved edition of the original book, and the response to this
publication has been so warm and enthusiastic that I now feel a close
kinship with many thousands of persons. I hear from them constantly,
through telephone calls, letters, messages and articles, and I am
greeted as an old friend in the most unexpected places.

My daughter says that when my book is praised I purr like a cat. Perhaps
I do. I can’t help it for I am a fortunate woman.

After middle age, my family duties ended, my brood scattered, my civic
and social interests (properly) in younger hands, many familiar doors
seemed closed to me. Suddenly a new one flew open. It has led to a
multitude of human contacts, experiences and gratifications. I feel
_useful_ once more, far more useful than I ever expected to be. Who
wouldn’t purr? Thanks to you, my friends, known and unknown, for your
many manifestations of approval and appreciation. I have tried out a
number of recipes you sent me, some of which you will find in these
pages. I regret that all could not be included.

When the revision of this book was begun a year ago we had no intimation
that international obligations would lead our land of plenty to ration
cards. It now goes to print with a number of emergency chapters added,
written to meet the difficulties that beset the present-day cook.

It has been a pleasure to compile this record of our American way of
life. Tradition speaks to us in its pages, a tradition of plenty which
should always be ours, and which will be, with the intelligent use of
our mighty weapon, the cooking spoon.

                          _THE JOY OF COOKING_




                               Cocktails


The chief virtue of cocktails is their informal quality. They loosen
{pg 17}tongues and unbutton the reserves of the socially diffident.
Serve them by all means, preferably in the living room, and the sooner
the better. They may be alcoholic or non-alcoholic. For the benefit of a
minority serve the latter with the former.

To give this book the impression of sobriety and stability it deserves,
the alcoholic cocktails have been relegated to the chapter on Beverages.
There they may blush unseen by those who disapprove of them and they may
be readily found in the company of many other good drinks by those who
do not.

                         Canapés and Sandwiches


Innumerable hostesses—not to mention quick-lunch stands—keep green the
memory of Lord Sandwich, whose mania for gambling gave the world the
well-known concoction that bears his name.


                       Hot Canapés and Sandwiches

                 RULE FOR TOASTED CANAPÉS OR SANDWICHES

_For Canapés:_

Spread one of the following fillings between trimmed slices of
bread[1]—cut the slices into small attractive shapes or roll them and
secure the rolls with toothpicks. Toast them immediately before serving
them.

_For Sandwiches:_

Follow the rule for canapés. Serve more generous portions.

These canapés or sandwiches may be prepared in advance, if wrapped in a
damp cloth or in waxed paper until toasted. Toast them on both sides
immediately before they are served.

-----

[1] For rolled sandwiches use fresh bread. For other sandwiches use
one-day-old bread.

                          QUICK CANAPÉ SPREADS

A large number of canapé and sandwich spreads may be purchased ready for
use. Chopped raw onions, herbs, including chives or parsley, chopped
celery, olives, etc., may be added to these. They may be seasoned with
some favorite condiment of your own if you wish to give them an original
touch, but on the whole they are acceptable as they are.

Spread these on potato chips, rye crisp, tortillas or any of the good
crackers to be had in all shops, or on toasted rye, white or graham
bread cut into attractive shapes. The bread may be buttered.

If you prefer some concoction of your own, have fish paste on hand
(anchovy, sardelle, etc.), cheese, caviar, antipasto, braunschweiger
sausage, etc.

                      Cold Canapés and Sandwiches

_To Harden Bread for Slicing:_ {pg 31}

This is a suggestion that may prove to be helpful. If bread is too fresh
to slice easily place it in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. The
cold air will harden the bread sufficiently to make it slice readily.
For rolled sandwiches use fresh bread. For other sandwiches use
one-day-old bread.

                             BUTTER SPREADS

There are many ways of preparing good, quick sandwich spreads with a
butter basis. Beat butter until soft. Add other ingredients gradually.
Chill the butter mixture until it is a good consistency to spread, or
cut it into small blocks and serve them with salad.

Beat until soft:

     4 tablespoons butter

Add to the butter slowly one or more of the following:

     ½ teaspoon lemon juice
     ½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce or ½ teaspoon dry mustard
     ½ teaspoon grated onion or minced garlic

Good additions to the butter mixture are:

     2 tablespoons chopped parsley
     2 tablespoons chopped chives
     1 tablespoon chopped mixed herbs
     2 tablespoons chopped watercress
     ¼ cup soft or grated cheese
     2 tablespoons fish paste
     2 tablespoons horseradish
     1 tablespoon olive paste
     2 tablespoons catsup or chili sauce
     1 tablespoon chutney
     ¼ teaspoon curry powder

Add if needed:

       Salt
       Paprika

                 *        *        *        *        *

                              HONEY BUTTER

Combine by the above rule for butter spreads:

       Equal parts of butter and honey

                 *        *        *        *        *

           Attractive Ways to Serve Canapés and Hors d’Œuvre

Place hors d’œuvre (shrimp and bacon, rolled chipped beef, codfish
{pg 40}balls, mushrooms, olives, etc.) on toothpicks.

I. Cut a grapefruit in half, place it flat side down on a plate or
platter. Stud the grapefruit with hors d’œuvre on toothpicks. Place
canapés around it.

II. Cut a cantaloupe in half. Remove the seeds. Place it flat side down
on a platter and stud it with hors d’œuvre on toothpicks, or place it on
a plate round side down and fill the center with cheese balls, olives,
etc. Stud the sides with hors d’œuvre on toothpicks and place canapés
around it.

III. Cut a pineapple in half lengthwise. Place it flat side down and end
to end on a long platter. Let the leaves protrude over either side.
Place on each leaf a maraschino cherry. This has a very decorative
effect. Stud the pineapple halves with hors d’œuvre on toothpicks.

IV. Cut a large colorful apple in half. Place it flat side down on a
plate. Stud it with hors d’œuvre on toothpicks. Surround it with
canapés.

V. Cut the top from a small red cabbage. Hollow the cabbage. Fill it
with mayonnaise. Surround it with cooked shrimp on toothpicks. The
shrimp may be browned in butter.




                              Hors d’Œuvre


Canapés and hors d’œuvre are appetizers—consequently any palatable
{pg 41}tidbit is suitable for this preliminary step to a repast.

Serve what appeals to your imagination but remember that, unlike the
overture to an opera, it is unwise to forecast in this course any of the
joys that are to follow during the meal. For instance: Should you serve,
either in the drawing room or at table, caviar in pickled beets or eggs
and anchovies on tomatoes, forget the very existence of the beet and
tomato when planning the vegetables for dinner. This is not a
superfluous caution, for one encounters many unnecessarily repetitious
meals.

If the hors d’œuvre are served in the drawing room choose something that
can be handled easily. Toothpicks (obnoxious word implying the original
purpose—happily diverted—of this article of commerce) are a help,
practically and decoratively.

There are recipes given in other chapters of this book that are suitable
as hors d’œuvre. It is difficult to place certain dishes under any one
heading as they obligingly play a double or triple role.

An index isn’t literature, but a careful perusal of it will sometimes
produce a poem. The following are suggested as appropriate for hors
d’œuvre:

Aspic salad                          Timbales
Tongue in aspic                      Tomatoes filled with cottage cheese
                                       or other filled tomatoes
Fish salads                          Creamed oysters with crabmeat and
                                       cheese
Small fresh fruit salad—avocado,     Oysters and sweetbreads on skewers
  grape, etc., with nut dressing
Small vegetable salads               Baked oysters on toast
Beets pickled or molded in gelatine  Oysters in spinach
  salad
Flaked lobster, crab, etc., with     Anchovies on marinated lettuce
  herb sauce

                                 Soups


Soups are given many enticing names, but they fall into one or the
{pg 49}other of the following general classifications:

_White stock_, made with white meats and light-colored vegetables.

_Brown stock_, made with dark meats and vegetables.

_Bouillon_, made with beef (part of which is browned in marrow) and
vegetables.

_Consommé_, made with beef, veal, chicken and vegetables.

_Broth or Extracts_ (clam and mushroom, chicken, etc.). Vegetable or
meat stock may be added to the latter. These soups are served clear.

_Vegetable Soup_, made with meat stock or fish stock (water in which
fish has been cooked or stock made with fish bones and trimmings) and
vegetable stock (water in which vegetables have been cooked). To these,
vegetables and cereals are added.

_Cream Soup_, (Purée or Bisque), made with cooked strained vegetables,
or cooked strained fish, to which a thin cream sauce (made with butter,
flour and milk or stock) is added.

_Cereal Soup._ Stock or cream soup and cereal.

_Chowders._ Thick soups made with fish, meat, salt pork, vegetables,
milk and crackers.

Several years ago the French Government conferred a decoration upon the
cook who prepares Campbell’s soup. It is regrettable that this
distinction could not be made to include all the soup manufacturers who
have brought to us this good and nutritious product at so low a cost.

It is advisable to keep several cans of soup on the emergency shelf.
They may be used in many good combinations, see page 69. A can of
bouillon and clear chicken soup should be kept for quick aspics and for
use in place of stock. Beef, chicken and vegetable cubes are in general
use for stock and gravies. Be sure to have them on hand. No substitute,
however, can compare with good homemade soup.

Most recipes for soup stock begin: “Take 5 lbs. of lean beef, 2½ lbs.
marrow bone, etc.”—thereby putting this dish among the luxuries.

By following the French custom of the _pot au feu_ good soup stock may
be kept on hand by utilizing scraps. Keep bits of bone, cooked meat,
chicken carcasses, fish and roast trimmings, vegetable parings, the
outer leaves of lettuce, unshapely tomatoes, celery tops, peapods,
parsley, {pg 50}etc., for the soup pot. Keep the liquid from cooked and
canned vegetables.

Use lamb and mutton sparingly—they are frequently strong in flavor; and
pork is too rich and sweet to make good soup.

If your scraps are insufficient buy a soup bone or an oxtail and a soup
bunch.

The proportions of the _pot au feu_ (anglicized—“icebox soup”) vary
greatly. See page 51, Soup Stock II.

A good rule is to use twice as much water as meat, bone and fat, adding
vegetables as desired. It is well to soak the meat for an hour in order
to draw the juices into the water that is to be used in making the soup.

Use but little seasoning until the soup is to be served, as it is
difficult to gauge the amount needed.

Vegetables should be added for the last hour of cooking only, because
they are apt to absorb the delicate flavor of the meat.

Soup made from fresh meat requires at least four hours’ simmering, in
which time it will be reduced to about one-half the original amount.

Soup made from cooked meat and left-overs requires less cooking than
soup made from fresh ingredients. One to two hours’ simmering is
sufficient to extract the juices from cooked food, in which time the
liquid will be reduced to about three-fourths of the original amount.

Soup is best one day old, when its flavor is intensified and its
seasoning is higher than on the day on which it is cooked.

                   SOUP STOCK I. Made with raw meat.

About 6 cupfuls of soup after 4 hours’ cooking

This is a good basic rule. More meat may be used and a veal bone may be
added or substituted for the beef.

Place in a soup kettle:

     3 pounds brisket, shinbone or other soup meat and bone

Sprinkle it with:

     1 tablespoon salt

After 1 hour add:

     3 quarts of cold water

After 30 minutes bring the water to the boiling point. If a clear soup
is desired remove the scum. This is optional, as the scum contains the
main nutritive values of the soup. Simmer the soup covered for 3 hours.
Add and simmer covered for 1 hour longer:

     2 cups or more chopped vegetables (onions, carrots, celery stalks
       with leaves, etc. See page 51)
     ¾ cup tomatoes
     ½ green pepper with 4 or 5 seeds

Strain the soup. Chill it, remove the fat and reheat the soup. Add more
seasoning if required. Serve the soup with:

     2 tablespoons chopped parsley

                 *        *        *        *        *

               SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES to the PRECEDING RULE:

Salting the meat draws the juices from it, therefore, it is advisable
that this be done but not necessary.

The meat may be cut into 1 inch cubes. Soak ⅔ of it as directed. Sauté
the remaining ⅓ in hot marrow or other fat until it is dark brown before
adding it to the soup pot. This will give both flavor and color to the
soup.

If a stronger meat broth is desired allow 2 cups of water to every pound
of meat, fat and bone. When so much meat is used only a few vegetables
are needed to give flavor to the stock.

After 4 hours’ cooking the original amount of liquid will be reduced by
about one-half.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                       CHICKEN or VEAL SOUP STOCK

This is known as white or light stock.

Follow the rule for Soup Stock I. Substitute chicken or veal for the
beef. Omit the tomatoes.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                                BOUILLON

Follow the rule for Soup Stock I. Use lean beef, a beef shinbone and
vegetables. {pg 51}

                 SOUP STOCK II. Made with cooked meat.

About 3 cupfuls of soup after 2 hours’ cooking

Cut the meat from the bone.

To:

     2 cups meat, bones and fat

add:

     4 or 5 cups water
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Soak the meat and bone in the water for 1 hour. Bring it to the boiling
point and simmer it covered for 1 hour.

Add and simmer covered for 1 hour longer:

     1 cup chopped vegetables (carrots, turnips, celery, parsley, etc.,
       see Vegetables for Soup below)
     1 small onion
     1 cup tomatoes
     ½ teaspoon sugar
     ¼ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon paprika
     ¼ teaspoon celery salt

Strain the soup, chill it, remove the fat and reheat the soup. Add more
seasoning if required. Serve the soup with:

       Chopped parsley

                 *        *        *        *        *

See Garnishes for Soup for good things to serve in soup (page 77).

               SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES to the PRECEDING RULE:

Meat and fish scraps, cooked or raw, bones, fat and gravy may be used
for making soup. Allow to 1 cup of these:

     2 to 2½ cups water
     ½ cup or more cooked or raw vegetables

After 2 hours’ cooking the original amount of liquid will be reduced by
one-fourth.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                          VEGETABLES for SOUP

       Tomatoes (fresh or canned), lettuce, cabbage, onions, carrots,
       parsnips, turnips, celery stalks with leaves, parsley, leeks, etc.,
       make good soup.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                   DRIED CELERY and PARSLEY for SOUP

Place on a rack in a very slow oven (barely warm) and dry until brittle:

       Celery leaves, stalks and roots
       Parsley or other herbs

When dry, crush them, put them in a closed container and set them aside
for future use.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                          SOUP with VEGETABLES

If a soup with vegetables is desired strain the meat from the soup
before the vegetables are added. Chill and skim the soup. Add pared and
diced vegetables and simmer them covered until they are tender. Cereals
may be added with the vegetables. See Cereals and Thickenings for Soup
below.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                          SEASONINGS for SOUPS

       Salt, pepper corns, freshly ground pepper, paprika, cayenne, celery
       seed, celery salt, bay leaf, garlic, thyme, mace and allspice are
       in general use for seasoning soups.

Season soup lightly in the beginning. Add more seasoning, if required,
immediately before serving it.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                    CEREALS and THICKENING for SOUP

Add raw cereals to soup with the vegetables for the last hour of
cooking. Allow to the original amount of water approximately:

     1 teaspoon barley to 1 cup water
     1 teaspoon rice to 1 cup water
     1 teaspoon oatmeal to 1 cup water
     ½ teaspoon quick cooking tapioca to 1 cup water

Stir the cereal into the boiling soup. This will be a very light
thickening. Add cooked cereal in any desired amount to soup shortly
before serving it. Add noodles, etc., to soup for the last half-hour of
cooking. Stir them into the boiling soup.

Additional thickenings are:

       Flour, eggs and cream

Soups cooked with starchy vegetables (dried beans, peas, etc.) will
separate and must be bound. To do this:

Melt:

     1 tablespoon butter

Stir in until blended:

     1 tablespoon flour

Add a small amount of: {pg 52}

       Water, cold stock or milk

Stir this mixture into about:

     3 cups of strained boiling soup

See Cream Soups (page 60), Chicken Broth with Egg (page 53), and Duchess
Soup (page 63), for examples of soups thickened with flour and with
eggs.

                           COLORING for SOUP

Caramelized sugar and Kitchen Bouquet are in general use for coloring
soups and sauces:

Prepare:

       Caramel Sirup (page 671)

The sugar is burnt until it loses practically all sweetness.

Or buy:

       Kitchen Bouquet

Use it sparingly in delicately flavored food.

Homemade caramel sirup is preferable.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                       TO REMOVE GREASE from SOUP

I. Place a lettuce leaf in the hot soup. When it has absorbed the grease
remove it.

II. Drag a piece of absorbent paper (paper napkin) over the surface of
the soup. A great deal of grease will adhere to it.

III. Chill the soup. It is a simple matter to remove grease from cold
soup.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                         TO CLARIFY SOUP STOCK:

Remove the fat from:

       Cold stock

Measure the stock.

Allow to every quart of stock:

     1 egg white
     1 eggshell

Beat the egg slightly and add to it:

     2 teaspoons cold water

Add it to the stock with the eggshell broken into small pieces. Place
the stock over a low flame. Stir it until it boils. Boil it for 2
minutes. Permit it to stand in a warm place where it will be undisturbed
for 20 minutes. Strain it through a fine strainer placed over a larger
fine strainer lined with a double thickness of cheese cloth.

                             SPLIT PEA SOUP

This makes an old-time family quantity, over three quarts.

It is a good way to utilize a turkey carcass, a ham bone, the water in
{pg 54}which a ham was cooked (or salt pork).

Soak for 12 hours:

     2 cups split peas

in:

     6 cups water

Drain the peas and put them in a kettle. Add and simmer covered for 3
hours:

    12 cups water
       A turkey carcass, a ham bone, or a 2 inch cube of salt pork

Add and simmer covered for 1 hour longer:

     ½ cup chopped onions
     1 cup chopped celery with leaves
     ½ cup chopped carrots

Put the soup through a colander. Chill it and remove the grease.[1]

Melt:

                        SPLIT PEA and FISH SOUP

This may be made at low cost, as many fish mongers give away fish heads,
tails, fins and scraps. Use the rule for Split Pea Soup to make either a

                              Cream Soups

The trouble with cream soups is that they are frequently served (with
whipped cream) as the first course of a heavy meal.

The wonderful thing about cream soups is that they are nearly a meal by
themselves. Balanced by a green salad or fruit, they make a perfect
luncheon for a non-reducing partaker.

Place on top of a serving of cream soup one teaspoonful or more whipped
cream. Garnish it with a dash of paprika.

                             BOUILLABAISSE

8 Servings

A fish and soup dish. The fish and the soup are served separately but
eaten at the same time. Toast is placed in individual bowls, fish is
added and soup ladled over it. The toast may be omitted and crackers
served with the bouillabaisse. Ingredients for this dish vary greatly
but the basic rule is the same. It calls for vegetables of the onion
family sautéed in oil or butter; to these are added tomatoes, stock,
seasonings, one or more kinds of fish and one or more kinds of
shellfish. This is a case of the more the merrier. Except in the case of
oysters it is usual to precook the shellfish. After a brief simmering,
wine and chopped parsley complete the dish.

Remove the meat from:

     ½ pound Boiled Shrimp (page 242)
     1 small Boiled Lobster (page 240)

You may add to the fish:

     ½ pound raw mushrooms, sliced

part from the soft part of the clams. Chop finely:

       The hard part of the clams
       A 2 inch cube of salt pork or 3 slices of bacon
     1 large onion

Sauté the pork very slowly. Remove and reserve the scraps. Add the
minced onions and hard part of the clams to the grease. Stir and cook
them slowly for about 5 minutes. Sift over them and stir until blended:

[1] Two No. 1 cans of minced clams may be substituted or use 2 or 3
dozen clams in the shell. Scrub them well. Place them side by side in a
stewpan, pour over them 1 cup water, cover them closely and steam them
for about 10 minutes (until they open). Remove them when cool to a
chopping board, discard the shells and separate the hard from the soft
part of the clams. (The hard part may be chopped or put through a food
chopper.) Strain the juice through two thicknesses of cheesecloth. Add
water, if necessary, to make 3 cups of liquid. Use this liquid in place
of the water given in the above recipe.

                              Oyster Stews

Here are three good recipes for oyster soup, which are like the little
bear, the big bear and the great big bear in nutritive value and effort.

The first calls for milk and is unthickened; the second for milk and
flour; and the third for milk, cream, flour and egg yolks.

The following recipe is used in the well-known Oyster Bar of New York:

                       OYSTER STEW (Unthickened)

About 4 cupfuls

Melt in the top of a double boiler:

     ¼ cup butter

Add and bring to the boiling point, but do not permit them to boil:

     1 pint oysters with liquor

Pour over the oysters:

    1½ cups milk
     ½ cup cream

Season them with:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon pepper or paprika

Place the pan over boiling water. When the oysters rise to the surface
add:

     2 tablespoons chopped parsley

and serve the soup.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                        OYSTER STEW (Thickened)

About 6 cupfuls

Place in a double boiler and heat thoroughly:

     2 tablespoons butter
     1 pint oysters with liquor

Combine and scald in a saucepan:

    3½ cups milk
     2 tablespoons butter
     1 teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon pepper

Combine and stir in a cup until {pg 68}blended:

     ½ cup milk
    1½ tablespoons flour

Add these ingredients to the scalded milk, stir and boil it until it
thickens and pour it over the hot oysters. Place the stew over hot water
for 15 minutes before serving it.

About 5 cupfuls

Heat well but do not boil:

     1 pint oysters

Drain them (reserve the liquor) and put them through a meat grinder or
chop them until they are fine. Melt in a saucepan:

    1½ tablespoons butter

Add, cook and stir until smooth:

    1½ tablespoons flour

Add and stir:

       The oyster liquor
    2½ cups milk
     ½ cup cream
     1 teaspoon salt
     ½ teaspoon paprika
     ⅛ teaspoon nutmeg (optional)

When these ingredients are smooth and boiling add the ground oysters.
Remove the bisque from the fire. Combine and beat:

     2 egg yolks
     2 tablespoons water

Add them slowly to the hot bisque. Reduce the heat, stir and cook the
bisque very slowly for 1 minute, or place the bisque over hot water
until ready to serve it. Immediately before serving sprinkle it with:

     3 tablespoons chopped parsley

If there is little oyster liquor it may be necessary to thin the bisque
with hot milk.

                  Canned Soup Recipes and Suggestions

Canned soups are a boon to any housekeeper. If there are women who fail
to keep them on hand they are working to their own disadvantage. It
would be a mistake, and false economy, to eliminate homemade soup from
our menus and to choose only the modern, easier way of preparing soups,
gravies and creamed dishes, but it would be equally unfortunate to deny
the usefulness of the canned product. As a timesaver canned soups stand
supreme. They may be combined in many interesting ways. {pg 69}

Homemade stock and vegetable juices (the water in which vegetables have
been cooked) may be added to them. This includes the liquor from canned
vegetables and from canned seafood—the latter must be used sparingly
because it is apt to be salty. Waste nothing that can possibly be used.
Store all juices suitable for soups and gravies (the water in which
sweetbreads, fish, etc., have been cooked) and stock—see Soup Stock II,
page 51—in glass containers in the refrigerator ready for use. See also
Stock Substitutes page 52 and Stock for Sauces, page 377.

Unusual seasoning provides variety. Some examples follow, but it is
impossible to list all the good results that may be achieved. Experiment
freely in order to determine what you like.

Remember, please, that some soups do not call for dilution. They are
ready to be heated and served as they are. Be sure to watch this. These
diluted soups may be used, minus the addition of milk, water or other
liquid, in all the combinations suggested in this chapter for condensed
soups.

When combining a thick condensed soup with a thinner liquid good results
are obtained by stirring the second slowly into the first. Do this over
low heat. The quickest and easiest way to combine the two is to use a
wire stirrer (usually called a spiral egg beater). See page 377. This
little implement is ideal for sauces and other food inclined to lump and
be troublesome. Canned soups are fine for quick sauces and gravies. See
page 392.

_Important Note_: The word “can” may be confusing. The usual can of
condensed soup contains 10½ ounces and ready-to-serve soup contains 1
pound, or 16 ounces.

So with a clear conscience let us go on to “soup of the evening,
beautiful soup!”

serve it too often.

                            JELLIED BOUILLON

See rule for Soup Stock I and II (pages 50 and 51).

Stock made from a veal knuckle bone and a beef bone will jell readily.
To jell other stock use gelatine. Allow about 2 tablespoonfuls of
gelatine to 4 cups of liquid. Flavor the soup with lemon, vinegar or
cooking sherry. Season it well and serve it very cold. See Aspic Salad
(page 421).

                     QUICK JELLIED CONSOMMÉ or SOUP

1. A flavored gelatine preparation for jellied soup may be purchased
ready to be dissolved and chilled.

2. Canned jellied consommé of different kinds may be purchased and need
only be placed in a refrigerator for about four hours to be set
sufficiently for use. Full instructions are given on the label of the
can. It is wise to keep some of this in the refrigerator ready at all
times. This jelly is fine for soup but not quite firm enough for an
aspic.

3. Soak 1 tablespoon gelatine in ½ cup of Stock or Stock Substitute
(page 52). Dissolve it in 1½ cups hot stock. Flavor it with
Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice or sherry. Season it well. Chill it
and you have enough jellied soup for four small servings. Serve it very
cold in cups with wedges of lemon and sprigs of parsley.

Remember that left-over liquid in which vegetables have been cooked, or
liquor from cans, plus a bouillon cube or two, will make a palatable
basis for consommé or aspic.

To chill a soup quickly place the dish containing it in a bowl of ice
water or cracked ice.

     ½ teaspoon grated onion or onion juice (optional)
     2 cups clear Stock (page 50)[1]

       A few grains of cayenne

Dissolve the gelatine in the hot stock. Cool it. Flavor it with:

       Lemon juice, sherry or
       Worcestershire sauce

Strain the stock and pour it into a wet mold. Chill it. The bouillon may
be beaten slightly before it is served. The top may be garnished with:

6 Servings

Farina balls are heavier than soup custard, so it is advisable to serve
them with a light meal. They are fine for invalids and children.

Heat to the boiling point:

     2 cups milk

Add, stir and cook until thick:

     ½ cup farina
     1 tablespoon butter
     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika
     ⅛ teaspoon nutmeg (optional)

Remove the batter from the fire and beat in one at a time:

     2 eggs

Drop the batter (a generous teaspoonful at a time) into simmering soup
stock. Cook it for 2 minutes and serve the soup.

Add about:

     ⅔ cup flour

to make a rather stiff dough. Knead it and permit it to stand covered
for ½ hour. Roll it until it is very thin and let it dry until it is no
longer sticky. Before it becomes brittle, fold it over several times and
cut it into narrow strips. Toss the noodles lightly with the fingers and
spread them until they are dry, when they may be used at once or kept in
a jar for future use. Drop the noodles into simmering stock or water and
cook them for five minutes.

                ADDITIONS THAT LEND DISTINCTION TO FOOD

Many people cultivate mental allergies toward things they do not know
well. Perhaps they have at some time had a dish so generously doused
with some spice that they have disliked it ever after. Use your spices
and herbs sparingly until you are sure of your ground, but give them a
chance. They add a variety and subtlety to food you should not overlook.

Try: Freshly ground pepper
     Cloves stuck into lemon slices for tea
     A bit of freshly ground nutmeg on eggplant, squash or rice
     Cinnamon with apples
     Ginger with pears
     Curry with eggs or meat
     Mustard with cheese
     Paprika with almost anything
     Bay leaf in bouillon or fish stock
     Chili in meat or rice dishes
     Add anise (a few drops) to sponge cake batter and later toast it for
       tea—delicious!
     The new vegetable powders (not salts), parsley, celery, onion,
       garlic, etc., are worth your attention. They may be used in
       emergencies as a substitute for fresh herbs and vegetables.

Charles Rector has called garlic the vanilla of vegetables. Use it to
rub the inside of a salad bowl or a skillet. If you like a lot of it and
don’t mind the consequences, mince it and add it to food, preferably to
hot butter, or add a whole skinned clove of garlic and fish it out
before the food is served. Of course, the humble—well, not so very
humble—onion is a good understudy; so is the leek.

As to the herbs—they are numerous and just now tremendously in vogue.
The fashionable woman seems suddenly to be cultivating an herb garden
(as less fashionable gardeners have been doing for centuries with far
less fuss). Parsley of course reigns supreme, but chives and delicate
celery leaves are not to be despised. Tarragon is the perfect herb for
salads, although this may be disputed by lovers of fennel. A bit of
thyme, either fresh or dried, is a fine thing added to a sauce, soup or
gravy. So is chervil and so on down the line. It is a very long one.
(See Herbs, page 763.)

Combined herbs (the French call them a bouquet) add a wonderful
something to stews, sauces and soups and combined herbs are marvelous in
the salad bowl. Add one or more of your favorite herbs (dried) to your
pantry shelf, also a choice of Worcestershire, A, A-1 or Tabasco sauce,
catsup, poultry seasoning, horseradish, the various new mustard
combinations, French dressing, etc., and you are ready for any
emergency.

Remember to let the original flavor of the food predominate. When
necessary to add character to what is already there do it with a light
hand.

Beware of becoming like H. H. Munro’s cook who had a way of serving up
chicken like beefsteak that bordered on the supernatural. {pg 83}


                          Eggs and Egg Dishes

Treat eggs gently. They like this consideration and will respond by
being tender.

Those who have a “good ear for cooking” find many ways of making eggs
palatable. Those who have not may be grateful for the numerous
suggestions given in this chapter.

The first thing to impress upon the novice is that eggs cook with a very
low degree of heat.

“It was so hot that you could fry an egg upon the sidewalk” is to be
taken literally. It can be done under favorable conditions. Eggs
solidify so readily that it is well to remember when cooking egg dishes
to place them over a low flame, or in a double boiler, to avoid the
disaster of a curdled dish. Should a custard or sauce misbehave and
curdle—owing to an excess of heat—remove it at once from the fire,
dump it into a cold dish and beat it vigorously with a wire whisk. By
this treatment it may sometimes be induced to behave.

Note: Salt is supposed to toughen eggs. If preferred, add it to egg
dishes when they are cooked.

               SOFT- and HARD-COOKED EGGS (“BOILED EGGS”)

Place eggs in boiling water, reduce the heat and keep the water under
the boiling point. Allow 6 minutes for delicately coddled eggs; 8
minutes for firmly coddled eggs, and 30 to 35 minutes for hard-cooked
eggs. If you have difficulty in regulating the heat put the eggs in the
top of a double boiler, pour boiling water over them and place the pan
over boiling water. Keep the eggs hot but do not permit the water in the
lower container to boil. The eggs will be hard-cooked in 35 minutes.
Plunge hard-cooked eggs, when done, into cold water to prevent
discoloration of the yolks.

                      SAUTÉED EGGS (“FRIED EGGS”)

Melt in a skillet over a slow fire:

     1 tablespoon butter

Break into a saucer one at a time and slip from the saucer into the
skillet:

     4 eggs

Cook them over a very low fire until they are done. While cooking slash
across the whites several times with a knife to permit the heat to
penetrate the lower crust. When the eggs are firm serve them seasoned
with:

       Salt
       Paprika

                 *        *        *        *        *

                 EGGS in BLACK BUTTER (AU BEURRE NOIR)

Follow the preceding rule for:

       Sautéed Eggs

Remove the eggs to a hot platter. Sprinkle them with:

       A few capers, 1 teaspoon chopped chives, garlic or grated onion
       (optional)

Add to the butter in the skillet and cook until brown:

     1 tablespoon butter

Add:

     1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar

Pour this over the eggs and serve them at once. Garnish them with:

       Chopped parsley

                 *        *        *        *        *

                              POACHED EGGS

Fill a skillet ⅔ full of water. Allow ½ teaspoon salt to 4 cups of
water. Bring the water to the boiling point, then reduce the heat and
keep it under the boiling point. Break an egg into a saucer and slip it
gently from the saucer into the water. Repeat this process. As the eggs
cook dip some water from the sides with a spoon and pour it over them to
cook the tops. When a film forms over the eggs and the whites are firm,
remove them from the water with a buttered skimmer and place them on
rounds of buttered toast. Eggs may be poached in a small amount of milk
or stock. When they are cooked pour the milk or stock over the toast.

                      SAUTÉED or POACHED EGGS PLUS

And it is the plus that gives them the punch.

Try these eggs on a small mound of:

       Boiled rice or noodles

Pour over them:

       Left-over gravy, well seasoned
       Mushroom, tomato or onion sauce[1] or cream sauce seasoned with
       mustard, curry, herbs, onion, celery, green peppers, capers,
       anchovies, etc.

4 Servings

Combine and beat:

     ¼ cup milk
     4 egg yolks
     1 teaspoon baking powder

Combine and beat until stiff, but not dry:

     4 egg whites
     ½ teaspoon salt

Melt in a skillet over a very slow fire:

     1 tablespoon butter

Fold the yolk mixture lightly into the egg whites. Pour the batter into
the skillet. Cover the skillet with a lid. As the omelet cooks slash
across it several times with a knife to permit the heat to penetrate the
lower crust. When the omelet is done (after about 12 minutes) it may be
placed uncovered on the center grate of a slow oven 275° until the top
is set, or it may be folded over and served at once. (Make an incision
with a knife on either side of the omelet where you want it to fold. Tip
the pan and push the omelet gently with a spatula or a broad knife until
it folds over.) Serve the omelet sprinkled with:

       Chopped parsley (optional)

Creamed dishes (celery, sweetbreads, spinach, mushrooms, oysters, or
minced clams, etc.) are good served with omelet. A well-balanced
everyday combination is omelet with Boiled Macaroni (page 93) and Tomato
Sauce (page 384).

consistency, increase the heat to brown the bottom slightly. Fold over
the omelet and serve it.

                            OMELETTE POULARD

4 Servings

Madame Poulard, an ample, pleasing French matron of Mont St. Michel, was
known the world over for this dish. She cooked it in a very long-handled
skillet over an open fire. It is made without the addition of salt,
which is supposed to toughen eggs.

Beat until very light and foamy:

     9 eggs

Melt in a skillet over a low fire:

     6 tablespoons butter

Add the eggs. Stir them several times. As the omelet cooks push back the
edges. Let the liquid and foam run to the sides of the skillet. Some
foam will remain on top. Increase the heat and shake the omelet until it
loosens from the skillet and is a delicate brown underneath. Fold the
omelet and serve it. {pg 90}

                   SPAGHETTI, MACARONI, NOODLES, ETC.

These are inexpensive dishes (good fillers), easily prepared and an
{pg 93}ideal accompaniment to any number of foods. They may be cooked in
advance and reheated. It is best to moisten them with butter, cream,
milk, bouillon or tomato juice, etc., when reheating them on top of a
stove or in an oven.

You may combine the starch dishes with other ingredients, cooked meat,
sea food, vegetables, herbs, etc. They take a good deal of doctoring to
make them palatable. You may place them in a greased oven-proof dish and
bake them in a moderately hot to hot oven 375° to 425° until the top is
brown. Of course, you may serve them au gratin. They are doubly tempting
that way. You may serve them with sauce—tomato, creole, cheese,
mushroom, etc. Here are some brief rules for cooking these foods.

     RULES FOR BOILING SPAGHETTI, MACARONI, CREAMETTES AND NOODLES

Boil:

     2 quarts of water
     1 teaspoon salt

Add slowly and boil for 20 minutes:

     ½ pound spaghetti, macaroni or noodles

Drain them in a strainer. Rinse by pouring over them:

     4 cups cold water

Reheat them over boiling water.

Cook creamettes by the same rule for 12 minutes.

One-half pound broken spaghetti or macaroni is approximately 2 cupfuls.

One-half pound creamettes is 2 cupfuls.

One-half pound broken noodles is approximately 7 cupfuls.

Spaghetti, macaroni and creamettes will double in bulk.

One cup noodles will be 1¼ cupfuls when cooked.

Use the following combinations of cheese with these dishes:

     ⅓ part Swiss to ⅔ part American cheese, or
     ½ part Parmesan to ½ part American cheese, or
     ⅓ part Swiss to ⅔ part Cheddar cheese

In the following recipes spaghetti, noodles, macaroni and creamettes may
be used interchangeably if the amounts and the time for cooking are
properly gauged by these rules.

                               SPAGHETTI

The basis of this dish is usually an Italian noodle, cooked, to which a
tomato sauce is added. Into the tomato sauce you may put garlic or
onion, green pepper or other vegetables and ground beef sautéed in olive
oil or fat, but you need not confine yourself by any means to beef or to
the vegetables given above. Cooked chicken, chicken livers, liver, pork,
bacon, sausage meat or sliced sausage, mushrooms, clams, oysters,
anchovies, stuffed or green olives, stock, Worcestershire sauce, etc.,
may be added to the dish, which seems best when largely inspirational.
Some recipes call for red wine, cinnamon, cloves and other spices. Herbs
give it zest and cheese, preferably Parmesan, completes it. {pg 94}

Spread them out on cloths to dry. Before the sheets are too dry to
handle fold them over into a roll and cut them into very thin shreds.
Toss them apart and permit them to dry thoroughly. Store them in a glass
jar until ready for use.

                                RAVIOLI

Sift onto a board:

    1½ cups flour
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Drop into the center:

     1 whole egg
     2 egg yolks

Moisten these ingredients lightly with warm water and knead into a
stiff, smooth dough. Cover it with a cloth and permit it to stand for 10
minutes. Roll the dough until it is very thin. Cut it into two sheets.
On one sheet put a teaspoonful of ravioli mixture in little mounds two
inches apart. Cover them with the second sheet which may be brushed
lightly with water. Press the top sheet gently around the ravioli
mounds. Press the edges. Cut the dough into squares with a mound in each
center. Use a pie jagger or a cookie cutter. Dry the ravioli for about 2
hours. Drop them into boiling, salted water (or into chicken broth).
Simmer them for 10 minutes. Remove them from the liquid with a skimmer
onto a hot platter.

Sprinkle them with:

       Grated Parmesan cheese

Serve with sauce or roast gravy.

Ravioli Filling

This is usually a spinach and meat mixture very finely chopped or put
through a purée strainer. Grated cheese and light seasoning may be
added. Sometimes the filling is thickened slightly with bread crumbs or
egg. There may be much leeway in the composition of the filling and you
may use any combination of meat and vegetables you like.

Filling:

     ¼ cup cooked puréed spinach
     ¼ cup chopped cooked meat
     1 egg
     2 tablespoons cracker crumbs
     2 tablespoons grated cheese
     ½ clove garlic, minced (optional)
       Stock, cream or gravy to form a stiff paste
       Seasoning

Or:

     ½ cup cooked, drained spinach
     ½ cup cooked minced chicken
     2 tablespoons grated cheese
     ½ clove garlic, minced (optional)
       Salt
       Pepper
     ½ teaspoon dried basil or ⅛ teaspoon nutmeg

Sauce

Melt:

     2 tablespoons butter

Stir in:

     2 tablespoons flour

Combine and stir in:

     4 tablespoons Italian Tomato Paste
    1¼ cups water

Stir and cook the sauce until it bubbles. The Anchovy Sauce for
Spaghetti (page 94) is fine for this.

When rice is cooked by the first method in the following rule, its
entire nutritive value is retained; when rice is cooked by the second
method some of the nutritive value is lost, but many people prefer the
drier, crisper grains. {pg 101}

Boil:

     2 quarts water (8 cups)

Add:

                         RICE “TAFEL” or TABLE

8 Servings

A Javanese dish served with many variations but adaptable to our own
favorite foods. As this is a very filling dish—nearly a meal in
itself—it is ideal for suppers or luncheons, followed by salad or
fruit. It may be made as elaborate or as simple as you wish. I shall
give it in its original form with suggestions as to its modification.

Grate:

       A fresh cocoanut[1] (or use about 2 cups canned cocoanut)

Scald:

     4 cups milk

Add the cocoanut. Permit these ingredients to stand for 2 hours in a
cool place.

Melt:

     1 tablespoon butter

Sauté in it until light brown:

     ½ cup finely chopped onion

Add:

     2 inches of ginger root, chopped
     1 clove garlic, chopped
    1½ tablespoons curry powder
     1 cup cocoanut milk or Chicken Stock (page 50)

Add the milk and grated cocoanut. Combine 3 tablespoonfuls of the liquid
with:

     1 tablespoon flour
     1 tablespoon cornstarch

Heat the remaining liquid and stir the starch paste into it. Cook and
stir the sauce until it boils and thickens. Season it as desired with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Strain the sauce. Combine ½ this sauce with about:

     3 cups cooked, diced chicken, shrimp, fish, veal, sweetbreads,
       mushrooms, etc., either alone or in combination

Boil: {pg 105}

     2 cups Rice (page 100)

Rinse and drain it. Have it rather dry and flaky.

The ceremony of serving this dish is part of its charm. In Java one
refers to it by the separate dishes, as a “One boy curry” or a
“Twenty-two boy curry” each boy representing one dish. Pass the rice
first. Spread it generously over your plate forming a base or table.
Pass the food in the sauce next.

Follow this with:

       Shoestring potatoes[2]
       Shoestring onions
       Sieved hard-cooked eggs
       Grated peanuts
       Grated cocoanut if there is none in the sauce
       Relish
       Chutney or preserved ginger, etc.

and the remaining sauce.

In the Orient a servant passes each ingredient separately. In America
the last four or five may be served from a large condiment dish.
Servings from these various dishes are placed upon the rice tafel. Cut
through the layers and proceed to feast.

-----

[1] If you object to cocoanut, if you do not like the flavor of curry,
do not discard this dish. Instead carry out the idea of the Rice Tafel
by substituting creamed chicken, Ragout Fin, or some dish you do like,
followed by vegetables and condiments served in some attractive way.

     ½ teaspoon paprika

Add:

     ¼ pound melted butter

ingredients. Place them in a greased baking dish. Cover the dish. Bake
them in a slow oven 300° for about 1 hour.

[1] Transcriber Note: Jambolaya spelling used in this cookbook reflects
the author’s attention to culinary history. The first recipe for “Jam
Bolaya” was published in 1878 in “The Gulf City Cookbook” by the Ladies
of the St. Francis Street Methodist Episcopal Church, South Mobile,
Alabama. It became “Jambolaya” in the 1893 cookbook “Favorite Dishes. A
Columbian Autograph Souvenir.” and later settled to the current spelling
of “Jambalaya”.

[2] The sautéed mushroom caps and the pimientos may be used to garnish
the top of the dish. They are highly decorative with a bunch of parsley
in the center.

                              CURRIED RICE

4 Servings

An unusual and delicious rice dish. Its popularity is undoubtedly due to
the restraint with which the spice is used.

Wash and drain:

     ½ cup rice

Pour over it:

     2 cups hot water

Place the rice where it will remain hot, but will not cook, for 45
minutes. Add:

     ½ cup tomatoes
     ¾ teaspoon salt
     ¼ cup finely sliced onion
     ¼ cup sliced green peppers
     2 tablespoons melted butter
     ¾ teaspoon curry powder

Place these ingredients in a baking dish in a moderate oven 350° for 1½
hours or until done. Stir them from time to time. At first there will be
a great preponderance of liquid, but gradually the rice will absorb it.
Remove the dish from the oven while the rice is still moist.

6 Servings

Freely varied each time it is made but in such demand that I shall try
to write a general rule for it.

Rinse and boil by the rule on page 100:

     ½ cup rice

Reserve the rice water. Prepare by the rule on page 322:

       Veal stew (1½ pounds meat)

Pare, slice and add for the last half hour of cooking:

     ½ parsnip
     2 carrots
     2 onions

Add:

     6 ribs of celery, sliced
     3 sprigs of parsley

Drain the stew. To make the gravy see the rule on page 378. There should
be about 3 cupfuls of stock. If there is not enough add chicken
bouillon, a bouillon or vegetable cube and water, rice water or sweet or
sour cream to make up the difference. If there is not enough fat add
butter. The better the gravy the better the dish. Combine the rice,
meat, vegetables and gravy and reheat them. Garnish the dish with:

       Parsley

You may add a dash of curry powder and some herbs, thyme, basil, etc.
(page 763). You may use left-over meat, gravy and vegetables. You may
serve the stew in a baking dish au gratin or in individual bakers.

A de luxe dish is this recipe made with rice, chicken, sauce (with cream
and chicken gravy), blanched slivered almonds. An everyday dish is this
recipe made with corned beef and some canned soup to substitute for
gravy.

add to it in any desired quantity, cooked or canned meat, fish, sea
food, bacon, or sliced sausages or hamburger browned in butter.

This rice may be packed in a mold, baked for 15 minutes in a 375° oven

       Creamed meat, fish or mushrooms
       Green beans, peas, etc.

                        BAKED PINEAPPLE and RICE

6 Servings

This good dish may be served with baked ham or fried chicken, or as a
dessert with cream.

Cook by the rule of page 100:

     1 cup Rice

Rinse and drain it. Drain, then cut into pieces the contents of:
{pg 108}

     1 No. 2½ can pineapple

Place in a buttered baking dish ⅓ of the rice. Cover with ½ of the
pineapple. Repeat the layer of rice and pineapple. Place the last third
of the rice on top. Dot each layer with:

    1½ tablespoons butter
     ¼ cup brown sugar

(Use in all 5½ tablespoons butter and ¾ cup sugar.) Pour over all:

     ¾ cup pineapple juice

Bake the rice covered in a moderate oven 350° for 1 hour. Uncover it and
bake it for 1¼ hours longer.

                  Rules and Chart for Cooking Cereals

In the top of a double boiler, over direct heat, bring the correct
amount of water,[1] with the salt added, to a rapid boil. Sprinkle the
dry cereal slowly into the rapidly boiling water, stirring constantly.
Cook it for five to ten minutes, then complete the cooking in the double
boiler over boiling water (or in a fireless cooker). It is well to stir
coarse cereals from time to time. Fine granular cereals may be mixed
with a little cold water before being added to the boiling water.

-----

[1] Cereals may be cooked in part water and part milk. Start them in
water, add the scalded milk when the cereal is placed over the double
boiler.

 CEREAL CAKES (CORN-MEAL MUSH, HOMINY GRITS and other CEREALS, SAUTÉED)

Roll cooked cereal into small balls, then flatten them. Or, pack a
cooked, lukewarm cereal firmly into a small loaf pan or a tin can rinsed
in cold {pg 109}water. Cover the mush. Chill it well, cut it into
slices. Spread the balls or slices with melted butter or drippings. They
may be dipped in seasoned egg diluted with 1 tablespoonful of water and
then in crumbs, flour or corn meal. Sauté them until well browned in
butter or bacon drippings. Do this slowly if you like them crisp.
Corn-meal mush may be bought ready for use. Serve the cakes with sirup
and sausages.

                  POLENTA (CORN-MEAL MUSH WITH CHEESE)

This Italian dish resembles American corn-meal mush. It is one of the
principal articles of food among the poorer classes of Italians, who
frequently buy it fried from street vendors. It lends itself to endless
variations. Cheese is sometimes cooked with polenta—sometimes it is
served sprinkled over it. Tomato sauce, meat gravy or a combination of
both is another favorite accompaniment. Polenta is served as mush or
fried mush in the place of a potato dish at dinner or as a main dish
with a salad for a lighter meal.

Combine and stir well:

     2 cups white corn meal
     2 cups cold water
     1 tablespoon salt

Place in the upper part of a double boiler over hot water:

     4 cups boiling water

Stir the corn-meal mixture in slowly. Cover the boiler. Cook the corn
meal from 1 to 3 hours. Add to it for the last 15 minutes of cooking:

     1 cup grated cheese (optional)
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika
       A few grains of red pepper

Or serve it sprinkled generously with:

       Grated cheese (preferably Parmesan)
       A few grains of red pepper

After serving the preceding dish, pour the remaining mush into a shallow
greased pan. Smooth it to the thickness of about 1 inch. Chill it
thoroughly. Cut it into slices. Dip the slices in:

       Flour

Heat until very hot:

     1 teaspoon or more bacon drippings or other fat

Add the slices. Sauté them slowly and long to make them crisp. Turn them
frequently. Serve the mush with:

       Sirup or molasses

                          GNOCCHI (with Flour)

4 Servings

An Italian dish which is either served as a separate course or in place
of potatoes. It is delicate and delicious.

Scald:

     1 cup milk

Melt in a skillet:

     2 tablespoons butter

Stir and blend in until smooth:

     2 tablespoons flour
     2 tablespoons cornstarch
     ½ teaspoon salt

Stir in the scalded milk. Reduce the heat to a low flame and add:

     1 egg yolk
     ½ cup grated cheese (optional)

Beat the batter until the egg has thickened and the cheese has melted.
Pour it onto a shallow greased platter or pan. When it is cool, cut it
into strips 2 inches long. Place the strips in a pan and pour over them:

       Melted butter

Sprinkle them with:

       Grated cheese (optional)

Bake them in a moderate oven 375° until the cheese is melted. The cheese
may be omitted in the batter and {pg 111}later without detracting from
the quality of the dish. In that case use an additional tablespoon of
flour.

This is the original recipe given me in Italy. I prefer poaching the
batter (after it has been cut into strips) in gently boiling water or
stock for one or two minutes, draining them and serving them with melted
butter. Cut into small shapes this batter is good served in soup. As it
is cooked it need only be well heated.

Heat to the boiling point:

     ½ cup milk
     5 tablespoons butter

Stir in until the dough forms a ball:

     1 cup flour

Remove from fire. Beat in:

     2 eggs
     1 teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon paprika
     3 tablespoons grated cheese (optional)[1]

and the potatoes. Sprinkle the dough with flour. Roll it into sticks ½
inch thick. Cut it into 1 inch lengths. Drop the gnocchi into simmering
salted water. Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes. Drain. Place them on a
pan in a hot oven 400° for about 3 minutes. The baking is optional.

before being baked or after being poached, or served with:

                          Oysters and Sea Food

There are various ways of preparing bulk oysters for cooking. The
favorite method seems to be to place the oysters with their liquor in a
saucepan and to stew them until their edges curl. The oysters must be
closely watched, as a degree too much cooking makes them tough. I prefer
either of the two following methods:

Drain the oysters, reserving the liquor, place them in a single layer in
a large colander over boiling water, cover them and steam them until
they are plump; or place the drained oysters in the bottom of a large
saucepan, cover them, and put the pan in boiling water until the oysters
are plump.

In the case of creamed oysters, or other dishes where drained oysters
are to be put directly into boiling cream sauce, it is not necessary to
cook them beforehand.

The oyster liquor may be used in making cream sauce or in some other way
in preparing oyster dishes.

                           CREAMED OYSTERS I

4 Servings

Drain:

     1 pint oysters

Reserve the liquor. Melt in a saucepan:

     2 tablespoons butter

Add and stir until blended:

     2 tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

     1 cup oyster liquor (or oyster liquor and cream, milk, chicken or
       beef stock)

Add:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika

When the sauce is smooth and boiling add the drained oysters. Heat them
to the boiling point but do not allow the sauce to boil. When the
oysters are thoroughly heated, season them with:

     1 teaspoon lemon juice or ½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce or 1
       teaspoon sherry

Serve them at once in:

       Bread cases (page 81), patty shells or on hot buttered toast

Sprinkle them generously with:

       Chopped parsley

These oysters may be served au gratin by placing them in a greased
baking dish or in individual molds, covering the top with bread crumbs
dotted with butter or sprinkled with cheese. Brown the crumbs under a
broiler. {pg 112}

                    OYSTERS BAKED in the HALF SHELL

This original recipe is the contribution of a Maryland man. He objects
to the fact that I, a landlubber, {pg 115}should have recipes for
“denuded” oysters only and suggests that this rule be given a trial. The
trial has taken place and the verdict is “superlative.” I shall give the
rule as much as possible in his own words, but I must begin instead of
end with his final warning: “Do not overlook, unless you are
extraordinarily nimble, that the sauce should be started well before the
oysters go into the oven.” Have the fish merchant open, on the deep
side:

       Oysters

Take them home and with the juice slightly warmed in a double boiler
make a sauce, adding to it:

       Lemon and onion juice
       Celery seed or salt
       Tarragon vinegar
       Mustard (heavy on this)
       Pepper
       Tabasco
       Not too much butter

Meanwhile, the oysters may start cooking[1] each in its own half shell
with a little of its own juice to prevent its drying out, propped
carefully on the open grid so as to be level. The heat must come from
below (do not broil). The fire must be mild. When the color of the
oysters begins to darken remove from the fire and serve with the rest of
the sauce drenching them.

-----

[1] A 325° oven is about right.

                          OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER

Allow 6 oysters on the half shell per person. The oysters are seasoned
with various ingredients and baked in a hot oven 450° to 500° for about
10 minutes (or until plump). (If unshucked oysters are not available,
buy oyster shells and use bulk oysters). Then they are browned under a
broiler. A complicated version is:

I. Add to the oysters:

       Butter creamed with onion juice and chopped parsley (reserve some
       of this)
       Salt
       A few grains of cayenne
       Cooked, minced bacon
       Puréed spinach
       Bread crumbs and the remaining butter

II. A simple version is to add to each oyster:

     1 teaspoon chopped parsley
       A few drops of lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce
     1 strip of crisp bacon

Or:

     1 teaspoon well-seasoned cream sauce
     1 tablespoon crabmeat
     1 teaspoon grated Parmesan cheese

in the center:

       Oysters

Season them with:

       Salt
       Pepper
       Onion or lemon juice

Cover them with:

       Thin strips of bacon

Surround them with thick slices of:

       Raw tomatoes

Sprinkle the tomatoes lightly with:

       Flour
       Salt
       Pepper
       Brown sugar (optional)

Dot them with:

       Butter

Bake the tomatoes and oysters in a moderate oven 350° for 20 minutes.
Have ready:

       Hot Mashed Potatoes (page 250)

Use ½ the amount given. Strain:

     2 cups (1 pint) oysters

There should be 1½ cups liquor. If there is not, substitute to make the

4 Servings

In regard to this rule I feel like the author of a well-known opera
guide, who classified Von Flotow’s “Martha” as a French opera. He stated
that of course he knew it was German but he thought it ought to be
French. Of course, I know that this is a soup but I prefer to classify
it as a luncheon dish, for if I placed it among the soups it might be
lost to fame and it deserves attention.

     2 cups (1 pint) oysters

Reserve the liquor. Melt in a saucepan:

    1½ tablespoons butter

Add and sauté for 1 minute:

     ½ cup finely chopped celery
     ½ cup finely chopped green peppers
     ¼ cup finely chopped onion

Add and stir until blended:

    1½ tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

    1½ cups hot top milk and oyster liquor

When the sauce is smooth and boiling add the drained oysters. When the
oysters are plump, reduce the heat and add:

     1 beaten egg

Cook the oysters for 1 minute longer to permit the egg to thicken. Stir
them gently. Serve them at once.

                       SCALLOPS, SAUTÉED or BAKED

These are usually fried in deep fat and served with Tartar Sauce (page
389) but that is by no means their limitation. Scallops may be very
quickly prepared. Try this way.

Dip:

       Scallops

in:

       Seasoned cream[1] or melted butter

Roll them in:

       Crushed cornflakes or bread crumbs (optional)

Permit them to dry for about 15 minutes (not necessary but the flakes
stick better if dry). They are then ready to be sautéed in a skillet (a
very quick process calling for from 5 to 10 minutes’ cooking), or they
may be put for that same length of time in a moderate oven 375° or they
may be broiled.

I like them well heated throughout, plus a minute or two in addition,
but that’s all.

-----

[1] You may add a dash of sherry or Worcestershire sauce, etc., to the
cream. Or, you may dip the scallops in 1 beaten egg diluted with one
tablespoon of water and proceed as directed.

   NOTE on BROILING or SAUTÉING INSTEAD of FRYING FISH, OYSTERS, ETC.

If fish is to be broiled or sautéed instead of fried in deep fat add 1
tablespoonful of salad oil to the beaten egg usually used instead of 1
tablespoonful of water. This added fat will brown the fish as evenly as
when fried in deep fat.

and again in the crumbs. Arrange them on individual oven-proof plates or
on a large platter. Pour over them liberally:

       Melted butter

Place over each plate of scallops: {pg 119}

       A slice of bacon

Broil the scallops under a broiler for 5 or 10 minutes (until the bacon
is crisp and the scallops are tender). Turn them so that they will brown
evenly. Serve them on the plates on which they were broiled with:

       Tartar Sauce (page 389) or
       Tomato Sauce (page 384)

                         Quick Casserole Dishes

The four following recipes are all variations on the same theme—a
starch, fish of some kind and a sauce. Please do not feel bound to
follow them too closely. The first—Rice, Tuna Fish and Cheese
Sauce—may become Rice, Tuna Fish and Celery, or some other soup sauce,
to which cheese may be added or not. The second—Tuna, Noodle and
Mushroom Soup Casserole—may resolve itself, thanks to expediency, into
Shrimp, Noodle and Tomato Soup Casserole, and so on. These dishes and
many other combinations are good, but even the author of a cook book
must have terminal facilities.

                    RICE, TUNA FISH and CHEESE SAUCE

6 Servings

Boil, then rinse:

     ⅔ cup Rice (page 100)

There should be about 2 cupfuls of cooked rice. Drain the contents of:

     1 (7 oz.) can tuna fish[1]

Break it into pieces with a fork. Melt in a saucepan:

     2 tablespoons butter

Stir in until blended:

     4 tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

     2 cups milk

Add:

     ½ teaspoon salt (more if the rice is unsalted)
     ½ teaspoon paprika
       A few grains of red pepper

Reduce the heat to a low flame. Stir in until melted:

     2 cups grated American cheese

Place in a baking dish alternate layers of rice, fish and sauce. The top
may be covered with:

       Bread crumbs

dotted with:

       Butter

Place the dish in a hot oven 400° or under a broiler until the crumbs
are brown.

-----

[1] The proportions of rice and fish in this excellent dish may be
varied. Sautéed Mushrooms (page 297) are a delicious addition. Increase
the amount of rice or decrease the amount of tuna, or make up any
combination you like. Use about ½ as much cream sauce as you do of the
other main ingredients combined. If preferred bake the ingredients in a
ring, invert it and serve it with the center filled with Sautéed
Mushrooms.

8 Servings

A meal-in-one dish. The salmon mixture may be prepared in advance, so
may the dough, and combined shortly before baking. A fine thing for the
hurry-up housekeeper. Canned vegetables—peas and asparagus, etc.—and,
of course, other fish—crab, shrimp, tuna, etc., may be substituted.

Drain the contents, reserving the oil of:

     1 (16 oz.) can salmon

Prepare by the rule on page 450:

       Biscuit dough

mixture in a large casserole. Roll the biscuit dough to the thickness of
about ¼ inch. Cut it into rounds. Top the salmon mixture with biscuits.
Bake in a hot oven 425° until it is done, for about 12 minutes.

6 Servings

This is a soufflé to which whipped cream is added, so it becomes
somewhat of a luxury dish—a fish mousse.

Grind or put through a ricer:

     1 pound (2 cups) uncooked fish[1]

Heat over a low fire:

    1½ tablespoons butter

Stir in until blended:

     1 tablespoon flour

Stir:

     ¼ cup milk

Beat and stir in:

     2 egg yolks

Season these ingredients with:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika

Stir the yolks for 1 or 2 minutes. Permit them to thicken slightly. Add
the ground fish. Cool the mixture. Whip until stiff:

     2 egg whites
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Whip until stiff:

     1 cup heavy cream

Fold these ingredients lightly into the fish mixture. Garnish a greased
9 inch ring mold with:

       Strips of pimiento
       Strips of green pepper (optional)

Pour the fish mixture into the mold. Set it in a pan of hot water. Bake
it in a moderate oven 350° for about ½ hour. Serve it with:

       Hollandaise Sauce (page 381), Hot Shrimp Sauce (page 391) or
       Horseradish Sauce (page 388)

                   FISH or SEA FOOD in CONDENSED SOUP

The most quickly made main dish I know is a combination of tuna fish and
condensed soup (tomato, mushroom, celery, etc.) The soup may be doctored
in many ways of which the following may serve as an example.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                    TUNA FISH with CANNED SOUP SAUCE

About 4 Servings

Heat:

     1 (10½ oz.) can condensed tomato or other soup

Add:

     1 to 2 tablespoons butter

The soup may be slightly diluted with:

       Stock (page 50), bouillon or water

Drain, flake and add the contents of:

     1 (7 oz.) can tuna fish

You may add:

     ¼ teaspoon or more curry powder

If you like a hot sauce add one of the following:

       A few drops of Tabasco sauce
     2 tablespoons chili sauce
     1 tablespoon horseradish
     2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
       A few grains of cayenne

If you like creole sauce add:

     ½ cup finely chopped green peppers, onion, celery, olives and pickles

The vegetables may be sautéed in the butter.

A winner in the race for time is:

     7 ounces grated tuna fish
       An equal amount of condensed potato soup
     2 tablespoons milk
       Chopped parsley (optional)

This mixture makes good fish cakes (page 131). {pg 125}

                        CREAMED FISH or SEA FOOD

This is a general rule.

Prepare:

     1 cup Cream Sauce (2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons flour, 1 cup
       liquid)

When it is boiling add:

     1 cup flaked fish, shrimp, crab,[1] etc.

Stir it gently with a fork until the food is hot. Season it as desired
with:

       Salt
       Paprika
       Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, curry powder or mustard, etc.
     2 tablespoons chopped parsley or ½ teaspoon dried herb (page 763)

Serve it on:

       Hot toast, rusks, waffles, pancakes, etc.

It may be served au gratin. Place the creamed fish in a baking dish or
in individual dishes. Cover the top with:

     4 tablespoons bread crumbs

Dot them with:

     2 tablespoons butter

or sprinkle them with:

The following good recipe is a contribution {pg 128}of an English woman
living in Massachusetts. I shall give it as nearly as possible in her
own words.

                       LOBSTER NEWBURG BARBARINI

To serve two rather greedy people. Double the quantity for five very
average servings.

Cut into pieces about the size of an almond:

       The meat of a medium-sized boiled lobster (or 1 package frosted
       lobster)

Set it to simmer in a small double boiler with:

     1 cup cream

If there is any coral in the lobster be sure to sieve it into the cream.
Simmer the lobster for ½ hour. Meanwhile, melt in a saucepan:

     4 tablespoons butter

Stir in:

     2 teaspoons flour

Stir in:

       Hot milk

Sufficient to make a smooth thick sauce. Cook it for 3 minutes. Transfer
lobster and sauce to a large double boiler. Season it with:

       White pepper
       Paprika
       Salt

The paprika is to give color and should be used lavishly. Let the whole
Newburg simmer happily along for about 15 minutes, then add:

     2 tablespoons of sherry

Simmer for another 15 minutes. Five minutes before sending to the table
add another dab of butter. Stir it well. Then add about 1 tablespoon of
cold water.[1] Just before serving add a little extra sherry to taste.

I serve this Newburg often in a glass baking dish with a lid of
Half-Puff Pastry (page 497), which has been cooked just before. We
always have cucumbers in a sharp dressing too—they give great piquancy.

If using domestic sherry, of course, cut down a little on the salt. I
always mess with my sauces and add as I go by rule of palate.

-----

[1] Do not inquire as to the why of the cold water. It may be lunacy on
my part, but I firmly believe that it gives a special smoothness.

4 Servings

You may use this rule as a basis and omit one or more of the ingredients

               VEAL KIDNEY, MUSHROOM, and ONION CASSEROLE

4 Servings

The original French recipe for this dish called for three tablespoonfuls
of butter. I have cut it to one, mindful of the indignant Englishman who
complained that he had belched his way home across the Channel from
France.

Dice:

     4 veal kidneys

Dust them lightly with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Boil:

     1 cup Stock or Stock Substitute (page 52)

Drop the kidneys slowly into the stock. Simmer them for 3 minutes. Drain
them. Reserve the stock. Remove the kidneys to a heated oven-proof dish.

     1 tablespoon butter

Sauté in the butter:

     ¼ to ½ pound sliced mushrooms
     2 tablespoons minced onion[1]

Stir in the boiling soup stock. Bring these ingredients to the boiling
point. Add:

     ¼ cup sherry, white wine or ½ cup orange juice

a moderate oven 350° for about 20 minutes. Toast:

     4 thick slices of bread (optional)

Sprinkle them with:

       Grated cheese

                            CHICKEN POT PIE

6 Servings

The following is a fine way of dressing up a plain chicken stew in an
imposing manner.

Cook:

     1 stewing Chicken (page 358)

Make about 3 cups of gravy as the crust is apt to soak up quite a bit of
it. Place the chicken in a baking dish, add the gravy and pour the
following batter[1] over it. Sift:

     2 cups flour
    1½ teaspoons salt
     2 teaspoons any baking powder

Combine:

     ⅞ cup milk
     2 tablespoons melted butter
     2 well-beaten eggs

Add these ingredients quickly to the sifted flour mixture. Stir the
batter as little as possible. Bake the pie in a moderate oven 375° until
it is light brown.

-----

[1] Sour milk corn-bread batter may be substituted.

                        INDIVIDUAL CHICKEN PIES

These are of two kinds.

Prepare:

       Stewed Chicken[1] (page 358)

Cut the chicken into pieces and add them to the gravy. Or, prepare:

       Creamed Chicken (page 144)

Prepare:

       Pie Dough (page 493)

I. Cut the dough into small rounds. Fit them over the reverse side of
muffin tins or small pie pans. Puncture them. Bake the pies in a hot
oven 500° for about 12 minutes. Fill the hot (or the reheated) shells
with the hot chicken mixture. Serve them garnished with parsley.

II. Line individual pie pans with Pie Dough. Brush the inner surface
with white of egg. Fill them with cooked chicken, creamed or in gravy.
Cover them with a thin top of pie dough brushed on the inside with white
of egg. Press down the edges and puncture the top crusts. Bake the pies
in a hot oven 450° for about ½ hour.

-----

[1] You may substitute other meat. A delicious addition to the meat is
drained asparagus, cooked or canned, cut in pieces and added to the
boiling sauce or gravy. You may use the asparagus water and cream for
the liquid of the sauce.

                            HASH with CELERY

There is no set rule about making hash. In fact it makes an immense
appeal to the imagination. Cooks lacking that nerve-racking quality will
find the following recipe helpful.

Prepare:

     ½ cup chopped celery
     ¼ cup chopped green pepper
     ¼ cup chopped onion

Drop them into:

     ¾ cup boiling water

Seasoned with:

     ⅛ teaspoon salt

When the vegetables are tender, drain them. Reserve the liquor as it may
be needed for the gravy. If there is enough roast gravy available use
it. If there is not enough thicken the vegetable water with:

     1 tablespoon flour

and add it to the roast gravy. If there is no gravy make it in the
following way.

Melt:

    1½ tablespoons butter

Add and stir until blended:

    1½ tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

     ¾ cup vegetable water

Add:

     1 tablespoon catsup (optional)
       or
     2 tablespoons tomato pulp (optional)

Add if required:

       Salt
       Paprika

Heat the gravy to the boiling point. Add:

     1 beef cube[1]

Add the drained vegetables and:

     1 cup cooked meat, diced

Remove the hash from the fire as soon as the meat is heated. Do not let
the gravy boil after adding the meat. Unnecessary boiling does not
improve the flavor of beef and sometimes causes it to become tough. To
keep the hash hot place the saucepan in hot water. Serve the hash on:

       Hot Waffles, hot toast, or in a hot Pie Shell or Pancake (See
       Filled Pancake, page 119)

-----

[1] If a beef cube is not available use canned bouillon instead of
vegetable water.

                           HASH with POTATOES

6 Servings

This is an excellent combination. If it is not feasible to use all the
ingredients given it will still be good.

Prepare:

     ½ cup cooked, diced potatoes
     ⅓ cup cooked, diced onions
     ⅓ cup seeded, sliced green peppers
     3 tablespoons diced pimientos
     2 cups cold cooked meat cut into ⅓ inch cubes

Combine: {pg 154}

     1 cup left-over gravy[1]
     ⅓ cup tomato purée
     1 tablespoon butter

Season this well with:

       Paprika
       Salt
     1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Heat the sauce and add the meat and vegetables. Pour the hash into 1
large baking dish or into 6 individual baking dishes. Sprinkle the top
with:

       Bread crumbs
       Grated cheese

Dot it lightly with:

       Butter

Brown the dish in a moderate oven 350°.

[1] If there is no available gravy make it with 2 tablespoonfuls butter,
2 tablespoonfuls flour and 1 cupful of vegetable stock or water to which
1 beef cube has been added.

     ½ cup raw cubed potatoes with or without skins
     1 medium-sized onion

Season with:

       Salt, pepper, celery seed or ½ teaspoon dried herbs

Turn these ingredients into a hot, well-greased skillet. Cook the hash
over a medium flame until a crust forms on the bottom, turn it and brown
the other side. Stir it from time to time to let the hash brown
throughout. Shortly before it is done, pat it down firmly to form an
unbroken cake. This requires about ½ hour cooking in all. Serve the hash
with:

       Catsup or Tomato Sauce (page 384)

                 *        *        *        *        *

                           MASHED POTATO PIE

A very good way of using a small quantity of cold mashed potatoes and
bits of meat or vegetable scraps.

Line individual molds with a wall ¼ inch thick of:

       Left-over Mashed Potatoes

If the potatoes are very hard soften them with:

     1 or 2 tablespoons hot milk

Brush the inner walls with:

     1 egg white

Moisten:

       Chopped, cooked meat and vegetables

with a small amount of:

       Gravy, Tomato Sauce (page 384)
       Cream Sauce (page 380) or cream

Fill the molds and cover them with a layer of mashed potatoes. Brush the
tops with:

       Soft butter

Place the molds in a pan of hot water in a quick oven 400° for 15
minutes or until the potatoes are brown.

More luxurious than No. I.

Prepare by the rule on page 250:

     2 cups well-seasoned Mashed Potatoes

Beat in until very light:

     2 egg yolks

Whip until stiff:

     2 egg whites
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Fold them lightly into the potatoes. Spread the bottom of a greased
baking dish with ½ of the potatoes. Combine and place over them:

     2 cups finely chopped veal or other meat

                  CORN-MEAL MUSH MEAT PIE (TAMALE PIE)

6 Servings

The idea of using a lining of corn-meal mush is excellent. Any meat
creamed or in gravy may be substituted for the following combination.
The corn-meal mush pie becomes a tamale when the filling is highly
seasoned.

Grind or chop:

     1 cup cold roast meat

Moisten it with:

     1 cup meat gravy[1]

Add:

    1½ cups tomato soup or tomato purée
     ½ small clove garlic, minced (optional)
    1½ teaspoons chili powder

Boil:

     4 cups water[2]

Stir in:

     1 cup corn meal
    1½ teaspoons salt

Cook and stir these ingredients over low heat until the mush is thick.
Line a buttered baking dish with ¾ of the mush. Pour in the meat. Dot
the top with the remaining mush rolled into 1 inch balls. Bake the dish
in a moderate oven 350° for about 45 minutes.

-----

[1] Brown Sauce (page 385) or Cream Sauce (page 380) may be substituted.

[2] Part of this may be Stock or Stock Substitute (page 52). In that
case reduce the salt measurement.

This is a palatable, quickly made, everyday dish, an attractive way to
serve a small quantity of left-over meat.

Make by the rule on pages 450, 493 or with Biscuit Mix:

       Biscuit Dough[1] or Pie Dough (use 2 cups of flour)

Roll it until it is very thin. Cut it into an oblong. Use a pastry brush
and brush it lightly with:

     1 egg white or soft butter

(This will keep the crust from being soggy.) Spread the dough with the
meat filling being careful not to get it close to the edges. Leave about
1 inch at the sides uncovered. Begin to roll it loosely. Moisten the end
with water and plaster it down. Moisten the sides and pinch them
together. Bake the roll in a hot oven 450° until it is done—for about
20 minutes.

Or, cut the roll into ¾ inch slices. Place the slices in a lightly
greased pan. Dot the tops with:

       Butter

This roll may be prepared in advance and placed in the refrigerator
until ready for use. Bake the slices in a hot oven 450° until the dough
is done. {pg 157}

Serve them very hot with:

       Brown Sauce (page 385) or Tomato Sauce (page 384)

-----

[1] Make the biscuit dough a little drier than for ordinary biscuits or
it will be difficult to handle.

Fillings

I. Raw sausage meat may be used. It need not be moistened or seasoned.

II. Grind or mince:

       Cooked meat

Moisten it with:

       Thick gravy, Cream Sauce (page 380) canned condensed soup, Brown
       Sauce (page 385) or a little cream

Season it lightly with:

       Salt
       Paprika
       Mustard or Worcestershire sauce
       Chopped pickles

III. Crumble:

     8 ounces corned beef

Combine it with:

    1½ cups thick cream sauce[2]

Season the filling with:

     2 teaspoons A-1 or Worcestershire sauce
       Salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika
       A pinch of thyme, marjoram and sage
     ½ teaspoon curry powder
     1 tablespoon capers or chopped pickles

Any good chopped meat filling may be evolved with this basis. Ham loaf
or veal loaf may be substituted for the corned beef, but beware of
adding seasoning without tasting the mixture. Chopped cooked meat will
do and sea food is highly recommended.

6 Servings

This recipe and the following one make excellent hot canapés. For
canapés cut the dough into small attractive shapes. For hot luncheon
sandwiches make them a more generous size. If prepared in advance keep
them chilled until ready to bake, Please have the patience to read to
the end of this recipe. The fillings are recommended with gusto.

Prepare, using about 2 cupfuls of flour:

       Biscuit[1] or Pie Dough (pages 450, 493)

Pat or roll it until it is thin. This is a matter of taste—about ¼ inch
for biscuit dough, ½ inch for pie dough. Cut it into 3x3 inch squares or
into rounds. Place a filling on the squares, as much as they will hold
properly. Moisten the edges of the dough, fold it over into a triangle
and pinch it down with a fork. Place the triangles (or crescents) in a
pan. Brush them lightly with:

       Soft butter (optional)

Bake them in a quick oven 450° until the dough is done, for about 20
minutes. This may be served with:

       Brown Sauce (page 385)

                     CHIPPED or DRIED BEEF RECIPES

Chipped beef that is not soaked in boiling water for ten minutes has a
better flavor and more character than beef that is soaked, but you must
then be very careful to omit salt in your sauce and filling or you may
have too much.

                GERMAN MEAT BALLS (KOENIGSBERGER KLOPS)

6 Servings—about 10 two inch balls

Introduce this very good dish to your family.

Soak in water to cover:

     1 slice of bread 1 inch thick

Put through a meat grinder twice:

    1½ pounds meat (½ pound beef,
     ½ pound veal, ½ pound pork or liver)

Beat well and add:

     2 eggs

Melt:

     1 tablespoon butter

Sauté in it until brown:

     ¼ cup finely minced onion

Add it to the meat. Wring the water from the bread. Add the bread to the
meat and:

     3 tablespoons chopped parsley
    1¼ teaspoons salt
     ¼ teaspoon paprika
     ½ teaspoon grated lemon rind
     1 teaspoon lemon juice[1]

Combine these ingredients well.[2] Shape them lightly into 2 inch balls.
Drop them into:

     5 cups boiling Vegetable Stock or Stock Substitute (page 52)

Simmer them covered for about 15 minutes. Remove them from the stock.
Measure the stock. Make gravy of it (page 377) by using:

     2 tablespoons butter for every cup of stock
     2 tablespoons flour for every cup of stock

Season it, if needed, with:

       Salt

       Boiled Noodles (page 98) or Spaetzle (page 376)

Cover them generously with:

       Buttered Crumbs (page 300)

                     BEEF TONGUE with RAISIN SAUCE

An unusual dish—delicious and inexpensive. {pg 163}As it takes 1 hour
to make the sauce it is well to begin to prepare it while the tongue is
cooking.

Place in a kettle:

       A fresh beef tongue

Peel and add:

     2 medium-sized onions
     1 large carrot
     3 or more ribs of celery with leaves

Wash and add:

     6 sprigs of parsley

Barely cover these ingredients with boiling water. Add:

     8 pepper corns
     1 teaspoon salt

Simmer the tongue until it is tender (for about 3 hours). Drain it.
Reserve the liquor. Skin the tongue. Remove the roots. Place the tongue
where it will keep hot.

Sauce:

Blanch and split:

     ½ cup almonds (⅛ pound)

Add and simmer for ½ hour:

     2 cups water

Add and simmer ½ hour longer:

     ⅔ cup seedless raisins, closely packed

Drain the sauce. Reserve the liquid. Melt:

     6 tablespoons fat (from the tongue stock) or butter

Stir in until blended:

     3 tablespoons flour

Stir in gradually:

       The raisin and almond liquid and tongue stock to make 3 cupfuls
       liquid in all
     ¼ cup crushed ginger snaps
     2 teaspoons Caramel (page 671)

Add the almonds, raisins and:

     1 lemon cut into very small cubes

Season the gravy with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Serve the tongue with:

       Noodles and buttered crumbs or with a Noodle Ring (page 99) filled
       with green peas

                            Food on Skewers

If you have no skewers invest in a dozen or so—about five or six inches
long and of uniform length. The metal ones are ornamental but the wooden
ones are easier to handle. The unadorned pegs the butcher uses will do
as well as any if they are thin.

Allow about two skewerfuls of food for the average person. Place cooked
or uncooked food on the skewers alternating ingredients to make them
look attractive. Brush the food (unless surrounded by bacon) with melted
butter or drippings. If the food is to be baked stick the skewers into a
large raw potato. If it is to be broiled place the skewers over a bread
pan and turn them once while cooking.

Bake the food if cooked, in a hot oven 450° until it is hot; if
uncooked, in a moderate oven 350° until it is done. Food on skewers may
be heated in a hot, very lightly greased skillet.

If you wish you may roll filled skewers in cracker crumbs or Cornflakes.
If you do, give them about 10 minutes to dry before cooking them. They
stick better.

                    Suggestions for Food on Skewers

Raw oysters, bacon (you may take one strip to a skewer and wrap it
around as you string on the oysters, etc.) and slices of raw onion or
firm tomatoes. You may substitute cocktail sausages for the bacon.

                               Croquettes

                          RULE FOR CROQUETTES

About 12 Croquettes

While croquettes are frequently made with new ingredients (minced cooked
chicken, mushrooms, sweetbreads, lobster, oysters, etc.) they are also a
good means for utilizing left-over food.

Use about 1 cup of heavy sauce to 2 cups of ground or minced solids
(meat or fish and vegetables). Eggs and bread crumbs may be added.

The following is a good general rule but it need not be followed too
closely, as a great deal of leeway may be allowed, provided that there
is enough thickening to hold the ingredients together.

Prepare:

       Cream Sauce III (page 380)

When the sauce is smooth and boiling add:

     2 cups minced solid food (cooked meat and vegetables)
     1 tablespoon chopped onion
     2 tablespoons chopped parsley

When these ingredients are boiling, reduce the heat and beat in:

     1 or 2 eggs

Cook and stir them for 1 minute longer to permit the eggs to thicken.
Season the food well with a choice of:

       Salt
       Paprika
       Pepper
       Nutmeg
       Celery salt
     2 teaspoons lemon juice
     1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
     ½ teaspoon Tabasco sauce
     2 teaspoons cooking sherry
     ½ teaspoon dried herbs
     ½ teaspoon curry powder

Spread this mixture in a dish. When it is cool shape it as you wish.
Roll the croquettes in:

     2 cups sifted, seasoned bread crumbs[1]

then in:

     1 egg diluted with 2 tablespoons water or milk

and again in the bread crumbs. Be careful to cover the entire croquette
with the egg mixture to prevent the fat from penetrating. Dry the
croquettes for about two hours. This will permit the crumbs to adhere to
them. Place four or five croquettes in a frying basket at a time, no
more, and fry them in deep fat at 390° until they are a delicate brown
(see page 477). Drain them on paper placed in a colander. To reheat,
place them in a hot oven 400°. Serve them with:

       Onion Sauce (page 386), Mushroom Sauce (page 386), Tomato Sauce
       (page 384), Left-over gravy, etc. (page 377).

-----

[1] In Vienna we were served delicious croquettes. The bread crumbs and

4 Servings

Trim the outer leaves and the stem from:

       A medium-sized head of cabbage

Cook[1] it uncovered until it is barely tender in:

     2 quarts boiling, salted water (1 teaspoon salt)

Drain it well. Scoop out the inside, leaving an inch and a half shell.
Place the shell in a greased oven-proof dish. Keep it hot. Chop the
removed part. Add to it the contents of:

     1 (16 oz.) can corned beef hash, minced

You may add to this:

     ¼ cup or more sautéed onions
       A pinch of thyme

Moisten it with:

       Cream, evaporated milk or bacon drippings (optional)

Heat these ingredients. Fill the shell. Cover the top with:

       Buttered cornflakes

The cabbage may be heated in a hot oven over 400° for 10 minutes. It may
be served with:

       Onion Soup Sauce (page 393)

-----

[1] Do not overcook cabbage. It is best when barely tender.

6 Servings

Trim the loose outer leaves from:

       A firm head of cabbage

Cut out enough from stem end of the cabbage to make a deep well. Prepare
a filling by combining:

                       RED CABBAGE and CHESTNUTS

6 Servings

In _The House of Exile_ I read that the Chinese served red cabbage in
green peppers (see Pepper Cases, page 201). This dish is attractive
served that way.

Shell and blanch:

     1 cup Chestnuts (page 299)

Slice the chestnuts (optional).

Shred until very fine:

     1 small head of red cabbage

Place it in a bowl. Cover it with:

       Boiling water

Add:

     ¼ cup white wine or vinegar

Permit it to soak for 15 minutes. Drain it well. Heat in a saucepan:

    2½ tablespoons bacon drippings or butter

Add the cabbage. Sprinkle it lightly with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Sauté the cabbage until it browns. Cover it with a lid and simmer it for
10 minutes. In a separate saucepan, combine the chestnuts with:

     1 cup water
    1½ tablespoons sugar
     ¼ cup white wine or vinegar
     ⅓ cup seedless raisins
     1 apple peeled and thinly sliced

Simmer these ingredients covered until the chestnuts are tender.
Sprinkle over the cabbage:

     1 tablespoon flour

Add it to the chestnut mixture. Cook these ingredients until they are
well heated and blended. Season them if needed with:

       Salt

And, if vinegar has been used, with:

     1 tablespoon sherry (optional)

Serve them hot.

               STUFFED EGGS on ROSETTES with SAVORY SAUCE

8 Servings

This rather elaborate dish is worth the trouble because it is unusual.
The rosettes and the sauce may be made the day before they are served.

Prepare:

     8 hard-cooked eggs

Cut them crosswise into halves. Remove the yolks. Combine them with
equal parts of:

       Cooked, finely chopped, seasoned Spinach, or Creamed Spinach (page
       266)

Fill the egg whites with the mixture. Prepare:

     2 cups Cream Sauce I (page 380)

Season it with:

     2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
     2 tablespoons sherry
     ¾ cup chili sauce
       Salt
       Paprika

When the sauce is smooth and boiling add:

     2 cups cooked or canned shrimp or diced cooked sweetbreads

Prepare by the rule on page 481: {pg 180}

    16 rosettes

Place a stuffed egg half on each rosette and cover the eggs with sauce.
Serve them at once, or make the sauce and the rosettes ahead of time.
Reheat the sauce in a double boiler. Reheat the rosettes in a quick oven
400° or on top of the oven.

                               RAGOUT FIN

12 Servings

A very good creamed dish—delicate and far-reaching.

Boil by the rule on page 339:

     1 pair of sweetbreads

Chill, remove the skin and break them into pieces. Drain and cut in two
the contents of:

     1 (15 oz.) can asparagus tips

Reserve the liquid. Rub a skillet with:

       A clove of garlic (optional)

Melt in it:

     4 tablespoons butter

Sauté in the butter for 3 minutes:

     ½ pound of mushrooms

Remove them from the skillet. Add to the fat in the skillet:

     6 tablespoons butter

Add and stir until blended:

     6 tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

     3 cups of liquid (cream, top milk, asparagus water, Stock or Stock
       Substitute (page 52) or diluted evaporated milk)

When the sauce is smooth and boiling, add gradually the asparagus tips,
the mushrooms and the sweetbreads. Reduce the heat to a low flame and
add:

     2 egg yolks

Season the ragout with:

       Salt
       Paprika
       Nutmeg

Fold the sauce over the ingredients, taking care not to let it burn at
the bottom. Cook it for 1 minute longer to permit the yolks to thicken.
Just before serving add:

     2 tablespoons sherry or 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Serve the ragout at once in:

       Hot patty shells, on hot buttered toast, in Bread Cases (page 81),
       in a baked Noodle Ring (page 99), or on hot Waffles (page 489)

To reheat the ragout, place it over boiling water.

               OYSTER and MUSHROOM RAGOUT with VEAL BALLS

This is a bit troublesome. If you are a cook with the hurry-up approach
to meals, don’t bother with it. If, however, you care for unusual food,
try out this old cherished recipe. It was the specialty of a well-known
St. Louis hostess whose reputation as a cook reached a pinnacle.

Prepare by the rule on page 77:

       Meat Balls

Use veal instead of beef. Roll the mixture into ¾ inch balls. Cook by
the rule on page 339:

     1 pair of sweetbreads

Drain them, reserving the stock. Skin, then cut them into 1 inch dice.
Poach the meat balls covered in the simmering stock for 5 minutes. Drain
them. Reserve the stock. Sauté:

     ½ pound mushrooms

in:

     4 tablespoons butter

Sprinkle them with:

     4 tablespoons flour

Add gradually:

     2 cups drained stock

Season the stock well with:

       Salt
       Paprika
     1 tablespoon lemon juice

Add the sweetbreads and veal balls to the boiling sauce. Heat in their
liquor until the edges begin to curl:

     1 pint oysters

Drain them. Add the juice to the stock. Add the oysters to the boiling
sauce. Reduce the heat. Draw off part of the sauce. Beat in:

     2 egg yolks

Return the sauce to the pan. Do not let it boil but stir it gently over
low heat for about 1 minute. Serve the stew at once in ramekins or over:

       Buttered toast

                 *        *        *        *        *

                             BRUNSWICK STEW

8 Servings

Disjoint for cooking:

       A 4 pound chicken

Sauté it slowly until light brown in:

     ¼ cup butter or drippings

Remove it from the pan. Brown in {pg 181}the fat:

     ½ cup chopped onions

Place in a large stewing pan the chicken, onions and:

     5 tomatoes, peeled and quartered (about 2 cupfuls)
     1 cup boiling water
     6 cloves
       A few grains of cayenne

Simmer these ingredients covered until the chicken is nearly tender.
Add:

     3 cups fresh lima beans
     3 cups corn cut from the cob

Simmer these ingredients covered until the chicken and the vegetables
are tender. (The meat may be removed from the bones.) Season the stew
with:

       Salt
     2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

You may stir in:

     1 cup toasted bread crumbs

                 *        *        *        *        *

                         MUSHROOMS under GLASS

5 Servings

In former years the following dish was associated in my mind with
extreme luxury. Today it is within the reach of anyone with a few extra
cents and a glass bowl that fits closely over a baking dish. Trim the
stems from:

     1 pound mushrooms

Beat until creamy:

     ¼ cup butter

Stir in very slowly:

     2 teaspoons lemon juice

     1 tablespoon chopped parsley
     ⅓ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon paprika

Cut with a biscuit cutter and toast:

     5 rounds of bread ½ inch thick

When cold spread them on both sides with ½ the butter mixture. Spread
the rest on the mushroom caps. Place the toast in the bottom of a small
baking dish and heap the mushrooms upon them. Pour over them:

     ½ cup cream

Cover them closely with a glass bowl. Bake them in a moderate oven 375°
for 25 minutes. Add more cream if they become dry.

Just before serving add:

     2 tablespoons sherry

Serve the mushrooms garnished with:

       Parsley

with:

     ⅓ teaspoon salt

     ⅓ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon paprika

Melt in a skillet:

     2 teaspoons grated onion
     2 tablespoons chopped parsley
     1 teaspoon anchovy paste
     3 tablespoons thick cream

Cook these ingredients gently for about 3 minutes. Pour the sauce over

6 Servings

Both oysters and mushrooms are so good they call for no comment except
that they combine very well.

Drain:

     1 pint oysters

Melt in a saucepan:

     2 tablespoons butter

Add and sauté over quick heat for 3 minutes:

     ½ pound mushrooms

Add if butter is unsalted:

     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Remove the mushrooms from the saucepan. Melt in the same pan:

     2 tablespoons butter

Add and stir over slow heat until blended:

     3 tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

    1½ cups top milk or cream and oyster liquor

Stir and cook the sauce until it is thick and boiling. Add the mushrooms
and bring the sauce to the boiling point. Add the drained oysters. Fold
the sauce over the oysters, being careful that it does not burn on the
bottom. Season with:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon paprika
     ¼ teaspoon nutmeg (optional)

Heat these ingredients thoroughly but quickly and only until the oysters
are plump. Remove the saucepan from the fire.

     1 tablespoon cooking sherry

Serve it at once on:

       Hot buttered toast or hot rusks

To Serve Au Gratin:

with:

     ½ cup bread crumbs

Dot it with:

     2 tablespoons butter

Brown the crumbs under a moderate flame.

Another way of preparing the same dish is to sauté:

    18 large mushrooms

in:

     3 tablespoons butter

Place the mushrooms in ramekins—3 to each ramekin. Cover them with:

    18 large drained oysters

Season them well with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Cover them with:

6 Servings

This is a delectable concoction. Fine with a rice or noodle ring.

Prepare:

     1 cup Stewed Celery (page 280)

Drain it well. Prepare:

     3 hard-cooked eggs

Chill, shell and slice them. Melt in a skillet:

     4 tablespoons butter

Add and sauté for 3 minutes:

     1 pound mushrooms

Stir in until blended:

     4 tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

     2 cups top milk[1]

Season these ingredients with:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon paprika

When the sauce is smooth and boiling, add the stewed celery, the sliced
eggs and:

     ¼ cup sliced stuffed olives

The original recipe calls for (but it is really superfluous):

     ¼ cup grated American cheese

Just before serving season with:

     1 tablespoon cooking sherry or
     ½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Serve the mushrooms in:

       Bread Cases (page 81), on hot Waffles (page 489), etc.

-----

[1] Much better than the 2 cups of top milk, but a little more
troublesome is the substitution of 1 cup cream and 1 cup stock. Make the
stock with the mushroom trimmings, the celery water, an onion, a carrot,
parsley, etc., or use 1 cup of Chicken Stock.

                     VEGETABLE CASSEROLE with BACON

4 Servings

This very good dish served with Spoon Bread (page 376) is a complete and
delicious—if somewhat hefty—luncheon. Cut the tops off:

     2 green peppers

Remove the seeds and veins and slice the peppers. Skin and slice:

     2 large onions
     4 large tomatoes or add about 2 cups canned drained tomatoes

Grease a baking dish and place in it alternate layers of these
vegetables. Season them with:

     1 teaspoon salt
     ½ teaspoon paprika

and sprinkle over the tomatoes:

    2½ teaspoons brown sugar

Cover the dish closely and place it in a good oven 400° for 30 minutes.
Remove the cover and drain the vegetables. Measure the liquid (there
should be 1 cupful or more of vegetable stock). To every cupful allow:

     1 tablespoon butter
     2 tablespoons flour

Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour and stir it until it is
blended. Add the vegetable stock slowly. Cook and stir the sauce until
it is smooth and boiling. Taste the sauce to see whether additional
seasoning is required. Add the vegetables to the sauce and return them
to the baking dish. Cover the top with:

       Slices of bacon (optional)

Place the dish uncovered in a hot oven 500° until the bacon is crisp, or
serve the vegetable dish with:

       Slices of hot Sautéed Bacon (page 338)

Sometimes tomatoes are dry and {pg 188}there is not sufficient vegetable
stock. Add meat stock, or a stock substitute (beef cubes, canned
bouillon) to make up at least 1 cupful of liquid in all.

Three-fourths cup celery may be substituted for the green peppers. The
proportion of the vegetables may be varied, but in that case use scant
seasoning until they are cooked.

                            TOMATOES CREOLE

4 Servings

This dish is much like the preceding one in ingredients and flavor. It
is equally good and is prepared on top of the stove instead of in the
oven, which is sometimes an advantage. It makes a delicious quick
luncheon dish and a well-rounded one when served with bacon. Fine for
filling peppers or acorn squash.

Melt in a saucepan:

     2 tablespoons butter

Add:

     4 large tomatoes, skinned and sliced (or 1½ cups canned tomatoes)
     1 green pepper, shredded
     1 large onion, chopped

Cook the vegetables until they are tender (for about 12 minutes). Season
them with:

     ¾ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon paprika
    2½ teaspoons brown sugar

Strain the juice from the vegetables and add to it enough:

       Cream

to make 1½ cups of liquid. Add to this:

    1½ tablespoons flour

Cook and stir the sauce until it is thick and smooth. Combine it with
the vegetables and serve them hot on:

       Toast

with:

       Sautéed bacon

                 *        *        *        *        *

4 Servings

Peel and slice:

     5 firm medium-sized tomatoes

Melt:

     2 tablespoons butter

Sauté in the butter until browned:

     1 tablespoon minced celery
     1 tablespoon minced onion

Season them with:

     ½ teaspoon salt

Add the tomato slices. Cook them for a few minutes. Turn them while
cooking. Remove them to a hot platter. Dissolve:

     ¾ teaspoon curry powder
     2 tablespoons flour
     ¼ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika

in:

     2 tablespoons milk

Add:

     ¾ cup heavy cream

Stir these ingredients until they are smooth. Add them slowly to the
drippings in the pan. Stir and cook the sauce until it boils. Pour it
over the tomatoes.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                           GREEN CORN PUDDING

8 Servings

This is a luscious dish but it is a little difficult to give an exact
recipe for it because corn differs with the season. If the corn is
watery when {pg 191}scraped, it is sometimes necessary to add a
tablespoon of flour. That is apt to be the case early in the season.
Later it may be necessary to use more cream—up to 1 cupful. When corn
is right it looks like thick curdled cream when grated.

Grate:

    18 ears of corn

Add:

     1 tablespoon sugar
     ½ cup cream
       Salt
       Pepper

Place these ingredients in a generously buttered flat baking dish. Dot
the top with:

       Butter

Bake the pudding in a moderate oven 350° for about ¾ of an hour.

                    CORN FRITTERS (With green corn)

For a short period one of our local newspapers devoted a column to
masculine taste in culinary matters. Many men contributed their favorite
recipes and the author of the following graciously permitted me to use
it when I told him how much it pleased me.

    “When I was a child, one of eight, my father frequently promised
    us a marvelous treat. He, being an amateur horticulturist and
    arborculturist, would tell us of a fritter tree he was going to
    plant on the banks of a small lake filled with molasses, maple
    sirup or honey, to be located in our back yard. When one of us
    children felt the urge for the most delectable repast, all we
    had to do was to shake the tree, the fritters would drop into
    the lake and we could fish them out and eat fritters to our
    hearts’ content.

    “Mother was a good cook and a good helpmate, so she developed
    the fritter that was to grow on and fall from the tree into the
    lake of molasses or maple sirup or honey, as the case might be.
    Her recipe as preserved in our family is:

    “Grate twelve ears of corn, preferably sugar corn, then beat the
    yolks of three eggs with a very small amount of flour[1] (about
    a teaspoonful) and a scant teaspoonful of salt; beat the whites
    thoroughly. Mix the grated corn and yolks, then fold in the
    beaten whites.

    “Fry in butter like pancakes and serve hot. You will want more;
    so will your guests.”

-----

[1] Since writing this, Mr. William N. Matthews tells me that his family
has objected strenuously to the addition of the flour, so he asks me to
say that the flour “may” be used.

Who could resist the delightful idea of a fritter tree in full fruit?
Not I! I’m hungry as I write about it. Wouldn’t this be a good thing to
read to an invalid to whet his appetite?

                             Cheese Dishes

A question I am called upon to answer frequently is: “Why do my cheese
dishes curdle or become stringy?” The answer is: Cheese must be melted
over low heat. It must be stirred constantly. It must be removed from
the fire at once when it is melted. You may use a double boiler. High
heat and over-cooking are responsible for your failures.

Brillat-Savarin, the noted French epicure, said that a dinner without
cheese is like a one-eyed woman. Housewives, who have many luncheons to
plan, like cheese in the middle of the day, but most men prefer it as a
midnight snack (the pause that refleshes). Whenever it is served, it is
overwhelmingly popular and as a Lenten ingredient it works overtime.

                           CHEESE CUSTARD PIE

4 Servings

In Switzerland we had a vile-tempered cook named Marguerite. Her one
idea, after being generally disagreeable, was to earn enough to own a
small chalet on some high peak where she could cater to mountain
climbers. While she was certainly not born with a silver spoon in her
mouth—although it was large enough to accommodate several—I am
convinced she arrived with a cooking spoon in her hand. If she has
attained her ideal many a climber will feel it worth while to scale a
perilous peak to reach her kitchen. The following cheese custard pie was
always served in solitary state. Its flavor varied with Marguerite’s
moods and her supply of cheese. It was never twice the same, as she had
no written rule, but I have endeavored to make one like hers for it
would be a pity to relegate so good a dish to inaccessible roosts.

Follow the rule on page 493 for making Pie Crust.

Use:

     1 cup pastry flour
    1½ tablespoons lard
    1½ tablespoons butter
     ¾ teaspoon any baking powder
     ⅓ teaspoon salt
     3 tablespoons ice water (or just enough to hold these ingredients
       together)

Roll the dough and line a small pan or baking dish with it (about 8½
inches in diameter). Bake the crust for 20 minutes in a hot oven 450°.
Remove it from the oven, cool it slightly and fill it with the following
cheese custard:

Scald:

    1¾ cups top milk or cream

Reduce the heat and add:

     1 cup grated cheese

Stir until the cheese is melted. Add:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon paprika
     ½ teaspoon grated onion (optional)
       A few grains of cayenne

Remove the mixture from the stove and beat in one at a time:

     3 eggs

Fill the pie crust and bake it in a slow oven 325° until the custard is
firm (for about 45 minutes). The size of the pan is not important, but
the custard is best when it is about 1½ inches deep.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                            CHEESE TURNOVERS

Sauté until crisp:

     3 slices bacon

Break it into small pieces. Whip until stiff:

     1 cup heavy cream

Fold in the bacon and:

     1 cup grated cheese
     ⅛ teaspoon dry mustard
     ¼ teaspoon salt
       A few grains of cayenne
     ⅛ teaspoon curry
     1 well-beaten egg

Prepare by the rule on page 493: {pg 196}

       Pie Dough

Roll it until it is very thin, cut it into squares or rounds. Place a
teaspoonful of filling in the center of each. Moisten the edges lightly
with water and fold over the dough. Bake the turnovers in a hot oven
450° for about 20 minutes. Serve them very hot.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                       CHEESE, BREAD and EGG DISH

4 Servings

This simple dish goes well with a green salad.

Cut into ½ inch slices:

       White bread

Spread the slices lightly with:

       Butter

Cut 2 of the slices twice across, making 8 triangular pieces. Cut the
remaining bread into cubes. There should be about 4 cups of diced,
buttered bread. Place layers of diced bread in a buttered baking dish.
Sprinkle the layers with:

     1 cup grated cheese

Combine and beat:

     2 eggs
     1 cup milk
     1 teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon paprika
       A few grains cayenne
     ½ teaspoon dry mustard (optional)

Pour these ingredients over the bread and cheese. Place the triangles of
bread upright around the edge to form a crown. Bake the dish in a
moderate oven 350° for 20 minutes. Serve it at once.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                   BAKED ONIONS with CHEESE on TOAST

4 Servings

Peel, slice crosswise and boil[1] until nearly tender:

     6 large white onions

Drain them well. Place in a baking dish:

     4 slices buttered toast

Arrange the onions on the toast. Sprinkle them with:

     ½ cup grated American cheese

Beat well:

     1 egg
     1 cup milk
     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika

Pour this mixture over the onions.[2] Dot the top with:

     1 tablespoon butter

Bake the dish in a moderate oven 350° for about 40 minutes.

Serve it garnished with:

       Crisp bacon
       Parsley

-----

[1] The onions may be poached in milk.

[2] A simplified spread is a paste made of grated cheese, Worcestershire
sauce and seasonings. Place the parboiled onions on the toast, spread
them with paste, broil them until the cheese is melted.

stiff to spread, a small amount of:

       Cream or mayonnaise

Serve the fondue at once on:

       Rusks, rye bread or Melba Toast (page 475), etc.

                            CHEESE FONDUE II

This Swiss dish is unusually good. It is appropriate for
after-the-theater parties or for cold suppers. It will serve about 10
people but it usually meets with such favor that it is better to count
on only 8 portions if nothing else is being served.

Cut into dice:

     2 pounds brick cheese

Combine it with:

     ¾ cup butter

Stir these ingredients over low heat until the cheese is melted. Add
slowly:

     ¾ cup warm milk

Stir the fondue with a wire whisk until it is smooth. Remove it from the
fire and beat in one at a time:

     2 eggs

Add:

                         CHEESE SPREAD or SAUCE

It is a joy to know about this fine mixture for it is easily made and
may be kept in the refrigerator for days. It makes excellent toasted
cheese sandwiches. Use it as a spread or a sauce. For sauce, thin it as
you need it with a little milk in a double boiler.

Cut into small pieces and stir over very low heat, or in a double
boiler, until melted:

     ½ pound cheese[1]

Add:

     1 cup evaporated milk

Remove the pan from the fire and stir in:

     1 beaten egg (optional but recommended)

Stir and cook the cheese mixture very slowly until the egg thickens
slightly. Remove it from the fire. Pour it into dish. Cool it slowly,
beat it as it cools, cover and chill it.

[1] I find that a soft cheese is preferable to a hard cheese, but all
are good. Try one of the softer processed cheeses that come in ½ pound
packages.

              Tomato, Pepper and Other Cases for Hot Food

                RULE for MAKING and BAKING TOMATO CASES

Cut large hollows in unpeeled tomatoes, salt them and invert them to
drain for 15 minutes. Fill them with any desired combination of cooked
food. Cover the tops with bread crumbs and dot them with butter or
sprinkle them with cheese. Place the tomato cases in a pan with enough
water to keep them from scorching, and bake them in a moderate oven 350°
for 10 or 15 minutes or brown the tops under a broiler.

If they are too soft to hold their shape, bake them in well-greased
muffin tins.

Filled tomatoes are good on toast served with sauce, Cheese, Mushroom,
etc., or gravy. Tomato Cases may be stuffed with any of the fillings
given for Pepper Cases and vice versa.

boiling sauce to prevent it from becoming watery). Use ½ as much sauce
as there are solids. Or moisten the food with cream, stock, butter or
gravy and add bread crumbs, if thickening is required, to hold the
ingredients together.

To fill and bake the tomato cases follow the preceding rule.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                   ZUCCHINI CASES (VEGETABLE MARROW)

Zucchini is an Italian squash—now frequently found in American markets.
Choose short, round zucchini. Scrub but do not peel them. This vegetable
cooks very quickly when young. It is impossible to give exact
proportions for the filling, as zucchini vary in size. Besides, it is
not particularly important.

Cut the stems from:

       Zucchini

Drop the vegetables into:

       Boiling, salted water (1½ teaspoons salt to the quart)

Cook them until they are partly done (2 or 3 minutes). Drain them. Cut
off the long ends.[1] Keep the rounded ends for the cases. Hollow them.
Chop the pulp. Melt:

       Butter

Sauté in it:

       Chopped onions

Add the pulp and cook it for 1 minute longer. Add:

       Bread crumbs, Corn-meal Mush, cooked meat or fish

Moisten these ingredients with:

       Cream, butter, Cream Sauce, Stock or gravy

Season them with:

       Salt
       Paprika

oven 375° until they are tender.

-----

[1] There are various ways of utilizing these. See page 198.

If the zucchini are short and shapely keep them whole and hollow them
from one side.

                 RULE FOR MAKING and BAKING ONION CASES

Medium-sized onions may be hollowed and used for this purpose or large
onions may be cut crosswise or lengthwise into halves.

Peel, then boil until nearly tender:

       Large or medium-sized Onions[1] (page 281)

Drain them, cut a slice from the top {pg 204}and hollow them, leaving ¾
inch shell or cut them into halves and hollow them. Chop the pulp taken
from the centers.

Combine it with:

       Bread crumbs or cooked rice, chopped, cooked meat, fish, baked
       beans, mushrooms and bacon, or with deviled ham or nut meats

Moisten these ingredients with:

       Cream Sauce, melted butter, Stock, cream or gravy

Season them with:

       Salt
       Pepper
       Chopped parsley

Fill the onion cases. Cover the tops with:

       Bread crumbs

Dot them with:

       Butter

Sprinkle them with:

       Grated cheese

Place them in a pan with enough water to keep them from scorching and
bake them in a moderate oven 375° until they are tender. If they are too
soft to hold their shape well bake them in well-greased muffin tins.

-----

[1] Spanish onions require long cooking. Allow at least 1 hour in all
for small onions and longer for large ones. If raw food is used in the
filling shorten the time for boiling and prolong the time for baking the
onions.

                                Entrées

An entrée is meant to be exactly what its name implies—an entrance or
an opening wedge to a formal repast. It is also the main dish of an
informal meal. I have not devoted a separate chapter to entrées but they
are generously scattered through other chapters of this book.

They include: Soufflés, timbales, mousses, various egg dishes,
croquettes, sweetbreads, mushrooms, creamed dishes, lobster, oysters,
crab, food on skewers—in short, any light dish is appropriate that
lacks the heft that is deemed essential for the main course of a formal
meal. {pg 211}


                                Timbales

The timbale is first cousin to the reliable custard and to the flighty
soufflé. As it combines the good qualities of both, it is a valuable
member of the egg dish family. It is an attractive and convenient way of
serving light food and is therefore admirably suited to luncheon and
supper purposes. Usually it is cooked in individual molds, inverted and
served with some tempting sauce, but it may be served in a ring or other
large mold.

As a disguise for left-over food, the timbale is second only to the
soufflé. See page 217. The basis of the latter is cream sauce and egg.
In the timbale the cream sauce is omitted and a small amount of cream or
stock is substituted. The average timbale has more body than the
soufflé. This makes it easier to handle, as it need not be carefully
timed for serving and—a very valuable feature—makes it easy to reheat.
If you are sure of being able to serve your meal on time choose the
soufflé; if you are uncertain as to when you will be able to serve it by
all means plan for the timbale.

                           RULE FOR TIMBALES

Butter custard molds lightly. Fill then about two-thirds full with
timbale mixture. Place them on a rack in a pan of hot water. The water
should be as high as the filling in the molds. If a rack is not
available, fold several thicknesses of paper and place the molds on it.
Bake the timbales for about 20 minutes, or until firm, in a moderate
oven 325°. If baked in a large mold a longer time will be required,
about one-half hour. If the molds are covered with waxed paper (use
elastic bands to hold the paper in place) the timbale tops will remain
soft. Covered in this way the timbales may be steamed on top of the
stove. Place the pan over heat, keep the water simmering until the
timbales are firm. This takes a little more time than the baking of
timbales. A large lid may be placed over them to hasten the process. The
timbales are done when a spoon or knife inserted in the mixture and
withdrawn remains uncoated. Unmold the timbales onto hot plates. Garnish
them with parsley, pimiento, nuts, pickles, olives, etc. Serve them with
or without sauce.

                          CUSTARD for TIMBALES

4 Servings

In France the salad is served with the meat course and the vegetable is
served in solitary state. (It is usually worthy of this exalted
position.) Sometimes it is accompanied by a mound or ring of delicious
custard.

                                Soufflés


The soufflé is the “misunderstood woman” of the culinary world. It
{pg 217}is a simple and useful everyday dish but it is held in awe by
many people who entertain an exaggerated idea of the difficulties of its
composition.

While it should be timed to be served when it is at its peak, it may be
held over some ten or fifteen minutes without any more serious injury
than a slight shrinkage. Yes, properly made it _will_ stay up.

The soufflé is a luxury or an economy dish according to your wishes. It
is at all times delicate and tempting, so take your courage in your
hands and try it out. The worst that can happen is the sacrifice of a
few inexpensive staples, but if you read the following instructions
carefully there need be no such sacrifice.

Cream sauce and eggs usually form the basis of the soufflé. To this
basis cheese, vegetables, meat, fish, nuts, etc., are added.

                            RULE FOR SOUFFLÉ

Make a thick cream sauce of 3 tablespoons of butter, 3 tablespoons of
flour and 1 cup of liquid (milk, stock, vegetable water, or cream). See
Cream Sauce II (page 380).

Add the solids, cheese, etc., while the cream sauce is boiling. Reduce
the heat to a low flame and add the beaten egg yolks. Cook the sauce for
one or two minutes, stirring it constantly, until the yolks thicken
slightly, but do not permit it to boil. Season the sauce and remove it
from the fire. When it is cool fold in the stiffly beaten whites of eggs
and place the mixture in an ungreased baking dish. It will rise higher
when the dish is not greased, as it will cling to the dry sides.

The soufflé may be baked with an increasing heat, beginning with a slow
oven and increasing the heat slightly every 10 minutes until the oven is
moderately hot (325° to 350°) or by placing the baking dish in a slow
oven (325°) and baking it until the soufflé is firm—from 25 to 45
minutes—dependent upon the size of the soufflé.

Do not place the dish in hot water unless the recipe calls for it. The
water will keep the soufflé soft and in some cases it is preferable to
have it crisp and crusty.

However, when making a soufflé in a ring mold, or in any other dish,
with the intention of inverting the contents when done, grease the mold
{pg 218}well, fill it and set it in a pan of hot water. This will
facilitate removing the soufflé from the mold and will give it a uniform
consistency.

Soufflés may be prepared in advance, with the exception of the beating
of the egg whites, which must be done immediately before the soufflé is
put into the oven.

Onions and garlic add greatly to the flavor of the soufflé. If you like
them place finely chopped onions in the butter and sauté them for a
minute before making the cream sauce or place a bit of garlic in the
butter, sauté it for a minute and remove it before making the cream
sauce.

Evaporated milk makes a good soufflé. When using it take half milk or
stock and half evaporated milk and decrease the flour from 3 tablespoons
to 1½ tablespoons to one cup of liquid.

Carrots, onions and celery may be used raw if they are finely minced or
put through a food chopper. Be careful to add these ingredients when the
cream sauce is boiling.

Soufflés may be baked in a double boiler, over, not in, hot water. Use a
quart size. Grease it well. Pour in the soufflé mixture. Cover it and
cook it for about 45 minutes. Turn it out onto a hot plate.

                            CHICKEN SOUFFLÉ

16 Servings

We use the following soufflé so frequently as a company dish that I am
giving it as I first “composed” it. Since, it has gone through endless
variations. In a modified form it is now our regular follow-up dish to
any chicken dinner (provided the partakers thereof have not been too
hungry).

Stew by the rule on page 358:

       A 3½ pound Chicken

Mince the chicken meat. There should be about 2¼ cupfuls. Prepare by the
rule on page 380:

     3 cups Cream Sauce II (use chicken fat, chicken stock or stock
       substitute, page 52, and cream or top milk to make it)

When the sauce is boiling stir in the minced chicken and:

     1 cup chopped nut meats
     1 cup chopped cooked vegetables (or raw celery, carrots and onions)

When these ingredients are hot, reduce the heat and add:

     9 beaten egg yolks

Cook and stir for 2 minutes longer to permit the yolks to thicken.
Season with: {pg 222}

       Salt
       Paprika
       Nutmeg

Cool these ingredients. Whip until stiff:

     9 egg whites

Fold them lightly into the chicken mixture. Bake the soufflé in
ungreased baking dishes[1] (or in individual dishes) in a moderate oven
325°. After 10 minutes increase the heat slightly. Bake the soufflé
until it is firm, for about 45 minutes in all. Serve the soufflé with:

       Cream Sauce I (page 380)

Add to the sauce:

       Chopped parsley
       Capers

or with:

       Mushroom Sauce (page 386) or Poulette Sauce (page 383), etc.

This recipe has more body than any of the others given. Its proportions
may be varied.

                                  Fish


                            To Clean a Fish

Allow ½ pound of fish per person—then proceed to prepare it. Place
{pg 226}the fish on a large sheet of paper. Remove the scales with a
fish scaler or a knife. Begin at the tail and work toward the head. Pull
out the fins or cut them off. If the fish is to be skinned do it at this
time. Place it on a flat surface. Run a knife point down the entire
length of the backbone. Loosen the skin near the head of the fish and
strip it off toward the tail. Reverse the fish and repeat the process on
the other side. Cut a gash in the abdomen. Remove the entrails. Wrap the
waste in a sheet of paper. Wash the fish inside and out. Dry it
thoroughly with a towel.

To remove the odor of fish from the hands, utensils and dishcloths use a
solution of baking soda and water—about 1 teaspoonful of soda to the
quart.

To remove the bones from a fish see Planked Fish (page 232).

Fillets are lengthwise pieces taken from fish and freed from skin and
bone.

Fish steaks are slices cut crosswise from a large fish.

Many centuries ago a Chinese sage said: “If you would govern a country
wisely, do it gently, as you would cook a small fish.” Today experts
tell us to cook all fish gently—large and small—and they caution us to
cook them until they are tender only (no longer) in order to preserve
their delicate flavor. Fish is done when it can be separated easily from
the bone. Test it with a toothpick. With these two admonitions we are
ready to get to work, or nearly so. First, we must determine which is
the best way to cook our fish.

If it is a rather dry fish it is best to boil or steam it. If it is a
large juicy fish it is best to bake it or to cut it in pieces and sauté,
broil or fry it. If it is a small fish it is best to sauté it or to cook
it in parchment paper. Examples of these processes are given in the
following rules.

Frozen fish may be thawed before it is cooked or it may be put on the
fire while still frozen. It spoils readily after it is thawed, so use it
as soon as possible after it is no longer frozen. If it is cooked frozen
it will require a longer period for cooking than the time given in these
recipes. {pg 227}

                              BOILED FISH

Scrape, remove the entrails and clean:

       A fish weighing 2 or more pounds

To facilitate handling it the fish may be tied in a cloth. Place in a
kettle sufficient water to cover the fish.[1]

Add:

     1 tablespoon vinegar or lemon juice
     1 small onion sliced
     ½ cup chopped celery with leaves
     1 teaspoon salt

When the water boils immerse the fish. Reduce the heat and simmer the
fish covered until it is tender (12 minutes to the pound). Do not permit
the water to boil as that robs the fish of its delicate flavor. Drain
the fish and place it on a platter garnished with: {pg 229}

       Half slices of lemon dipped in chopped parsley

or with:

       Wedges of lemon and sprigs of parsley

Serve it with:

       Melted butter

or with:

       Cream Sauce I (page 380) and capers or Mustard, Shrimp or Curry
       Sauce for Fish (page 391) or Onion Sauce I or II (page 383), etc.

-----

[1] The seasoned water or stock in which fish is boiled is known as
court bouillon. The above is a very simple rule, the following a more
elaborate one.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                             COURT BOUILLON

A stock in which fish is cooked.

Melt:

     3 tablespoons butter

Stir and sauté in the butter for 5 minutes:

     ¼ cup chopped carrots
     ½ cup chopped celery
     ½ cup chopped onions

Add:

       A few sprigs of parsley
     6 peppercorns
     3 or 4 cloves
     2 quarts boiling water
     1 cup acid white wine or ½ cup vinegar

Rub a fish with:

       Salt
       Lemon juice

Immerse it in the boiling court bouillon and simmer it covered allowing
12 minutes to the pound.

                 *        *        *        *        *

             COLD BOILED SALMON (or OTHER FISH) with SAUCE

This is fine for a buffet supper—stunning to look at and good to eat.

Boil by the rule on page 228:

       A medium-sized Salmon or other fish

This may be done in court bouillon (see the preceding rule). Skin the
fish if desired. Place it in a long deep dish. Have ready the following
sauce[1]:

     ½ cup finely chopped onions
     ½ cup finely chopped dill pickles
     6 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
     2 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
     2 tablespoons finely chopped chives
     2 tablespoons capers
     1 teaspoon sugar
     ¼ cup olive oil
     6 tablespoons tarragon vinegar or lemon juice
     ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
     2 cups hot fish stock

While the fish is warm baste it from time to time with ½ the sauce.
Permit it to chill in the sauce. When the fish is cold place it on a
platter. Garnish it with:

       Pickled beets
       Marinated cucumbers
       Hard-cooked eggs, etc.
       Watercress or lettuce

Serve it with the remaining sauce.

-----

[1] The matter of the sauce is optional. If preferred, omit it and
prepare the following aspic.

Season well the stock in which the fish was cooked with:

       Acid wine, lemon juice or vinegar

and, if needed, with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Strain the stock and measure it. Allow:

     1 tablespoon gelatine

to:

     2 cups stock

Soak the gelatine in a little of the stock. Dissolve it over hot water.
Add it to the rest of the stock. Chill it. When the gelatine is about to
set pour it over the fish or brush it over the fish to glaze it, or
permit the gelatine to stiffen in a bowl. Turn it out onto a board and
chop it with a knife. Surround the fish with the chopped gelatine. Serve
the fish on a garnished platter (see next rule and Fish in Aspic, page
429) with:

       Mayonnaise

                 *        *        *        *        *

                          COLD SALMON (GLAZED)

Fine for a buffet supper or luncheon. Very decorative.

Wrap in a piece of cheesecloth:

       A 3 or 4 pound piece of Salmon

Follow the rule on page 228 for:

       Boiled Fish

Simmer it until it is tender. Drain the salmon. (Reserve the stock.) Let
it cool in the cloth. Remove the cloth. Skin the salmon. Use it as it is
or glaze it with aspic as directed in the preceding recipe. Arrange it
{pg 230}on a bed of:

       Watercress or lettuce

Garnish it with:

       Mayonnaise

Place around it:

       Cucumbers in sour cream with herbs
       Radishes
       Olives
       Deviled eggs

                 *        *        *        *        *

                              STEAMED FISH

This is a good way to cook a rather dry fish.

Scrape, remove the entrails, clean and cut into pieces:

       A large fish

Sprinkle the pieces with:

       Salt

Place them in a steamer or in a colander over boiling water. Cover the
colander with a closely fitting lid. Steam the fish until it is tender.
Unless the pieces are very thick it will not be necessary to turn them.

Serve the fish with:

       Melted butter or some sort of Fish Sauce (page 391)

or make a sauce of the drippings and the water over which the fish was
steamed. Use:

       Butter
       Flour
       The fish stock and cream (see Cream Sauce I (page 380)

Season it well with:

       Mustard
       Curry powder
       Worcestershire sauce or lemon juice

Sprinkle the sauce with:

       Salted almonds chopped

Garnish the platter with:

       Broiled Tomatoes and Onions (page 287)

A small fish may be steamed whole.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                               BAKED FISH

When baking fish, place a piece of clean muslin or cheesecloth in the
bottom of the pan; then when fish is baked it can be lifted out of the
pan and turned over on the serving plate without breaking.

This is a decorative and attractive dish.

Scrape, remove the entrails, and clean:

       A fish weighing 3 or more pounds

Stuff it with:

       Dressing[1]

Rub it with:

       Salt
       Soft butter or oil

Dredge it with:

       Flour

Season it with:

       Paprika

Cut 3 or 4 deep gashes in the sides of the fish. Force into the cuts:

       Slices of bacon

Line a shallow pan with heavy waxed paper. Place the fish in the pan
with:

       Bacon drippings or 1 or 2 slices of bacon

Bake it in a moderate oven 350°, allowing 15 minutes to the pound. Baste
it frequently with a mixture of:

       Hot water and butter (2 parts water—1 part butter)

Serve the fish on a platter garnished with:

       Slices of lemon
       Sprigs of parsley

and surround it with:

       Tomatoes filled with Mashed Potatoes (page 199)

The drippings may be strained, thickened with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

and seasoned with:

       Worcestershire sauce or lemon juice

or the fish may be served with:

       Shrimp, Mustard or Curry Sauce for Fish (page 391)

-----

[1] The fish may be baked without dressing, but it is better when
filled.

This is about the right amount of dressing for a 3 pound fish:

I. Dressing

Combine:

    1½ cups bread crumbs[1]
     2 tablespoons chopped onion
     ½ cup chopped celery
     2 tablespoons chopped parsley
     1 or 2 beaten eggs

Season these ingredients well with:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika
     ¼ teaspoon nutmeg (optional)

Use enough:

       Milk, melted butter or soup stock

to make a loose dressing. Fill the fish. Sew the sides together with a
coarse needle and thread.

-----

[1] This is a fine but plain and unsophisticated dressing.

II. Dressing

A Southern and more elaborate version {pg 231}of bread dressing is:

Soak for 10 minutes:

     1 cup bread crumbs

in:

     ½ cup sherry

Wring the wine from the bread. Sauté for 3 minutes:

     ¼ cup finely chopped green pepper
     ½ cup finely chopped onion

in:

     1 tablespoon butter

Add the bread crumbs and:

     2 teaspoons chili sauce
     ½ cup canned or Sautéed Mushrooms
     2 tablespoons chopped parsley

III. Oyster Dressing

(For a 4 pound fish)

Melt:

     6 tablespoons butter

Sauté in the butter until brown:

     ¼ cup chopped onion

Add:

     1 tablespoon chopped parsley
     2 cups bread crumbs
     1 cup (½ pint) oysters, whole or chopped
     ¾ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon paprika

                 *        *        *        *        *

                           QUICKLY BAKED FISH

Prepare for cooking:

       Small fish, pieces of fish or fish fillets

Season:

       Rich milk or cream

with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Dip the pieces in the milk and in:

       Bread crumbs or crushed corn flakes

Permit the fish to dry for ½ hour. Bake them in a moderate oven 350°
allowing 15 minutes to the pound. (If cut in pieces about 15 minutes in
all.) Baste them once while cooking with:

       Melted butter or bacon drippings

                 *        *        *        *        *

               BAKED RED SNAPPER with SAVORY TOMATO SAUCE

Prepare for cooking:

       A 3 pound red snapper[1]

Dredge it inside and out with:

       Flour
       Salt
       Pepper

Place it in a baking pan. Melt:

     6 tablespoons butter

Add and simmer for 15 minutes:

     ½ cup chopped onion
     2 cups chopped celery
     ¼ cup chopped green pepper

Add and simmer until the celery is very tender:

     3 cups canned tomatoes
     1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
     1 tablespoon catsup
     1 teaspoon chili powder
     ½ lemon finely sliced
     2 bay leaves
     1 clove of garlic, minced
     1 teaspoon salt
       A few grains red pepper

Press these ingredients through a potato ricer. Pour the sauce around
the fish. Bake the fish in a moderate oven 350° for about 45 minutes.
Baste it frequently with the sauce.

-----

[1] Some other large fish may be substituted.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                   BAKED RED SNAPPER with VEGETABLES

Prepare for cooking:

       A 6 pound red snapper

Cut deep gashes in both sides crosswise of the fish about 1½ inches
apart. Rub it well inside and out with:

       Salt
       Butter

Place in each gash:

       Salt
       Pepper
       A teaspoon of butter
       A slice of lemon

Prepare:

     ½ cup chopped celery
     ¾ cup chopped green pepper

                              PLANKED FISH

Scrape, remove the entrails, and clean:

       A fish, weighing 2 or more pounds

Split it lengthwise from the inside so that it can be flattened out.
Place it on its back and remove the bones. This can be done by making
incisions in the inside of the fish along the backbone and scraping the
meat from the bones with the back of a knife. The backbone and the rib
bones may then be removed in one piece. Go over the fish carefully and
remove the smaller bones. Place the fish, skin side down, on a plank of
hickory, oak or ash. Sprinkle it lightly with:

       Salt
       Paprika

and pour over it:

     ½ cup melted butter

and:

     1 cup rolled cornflakes or bread crumbs

Bake the fish in a moderate oven 350°. Allow 15 minutes to the pound.
Brown the fish for the last 5 minutes under a broiler. Serve it
garnished with:

       Mashed Potatoes
       Beet cups filled with tartar sauce
       Parsley, etc.

paper in a pan and put the fish flat upon it, skin side down.

Season it with:

       Salt

Dredge it with:

       Flour, cracker crumbs or cornflakes

Dot it with:

       Butter

       Paprika

Cook the fish on the upper grate of a hot oven 400° from 20 to 30
minutes. Serve it with:

       Slices of lemon
       Chopped parsley

                 *        *        *        *        *

                            BROILED FISH II

Rub the fish inside and out with these ingredients. Place it on a
well-greased broiler. Broil it until it is brown. Turn it once. Spread
it with:

       Maître d’Hôtel Butter (page 390)

or serve it with:

       Drawn Butter Sauce (page 390)

Garnish it with:

       Parsley
       Cucumbers in sour cream with herbs

                 *        *        *        *        *

                     FISH COOKED in PARCHMENT PAPER

Clean:

       Small fish[1]

Place each fish on a piece of parchment paper. Fold it over. Cut it
along the lines of the fish leaving a margin of 1¼ inches. Remove the
paper. Spread it well with:

       Olive oil or butter

Season the fish inside and out with:

       Salt
       Paprika
       Lemon juice

Replace it in the paper. Fold over the edges of the paper like a hem.
Fasten it with paper clips so that the paper will retain the juices.
Place the fish on a rack in a moderate oven 350° for about 20 minutes.
Unpin the papers. Slide the fish and the juices onto a platter garnished
with:

       Lemon slices

                      SAUTÉED FISH (“Fried Fish”)

Scrape, remove the entrails and clean:

       A large fish (or several small fish)

Cut the large fish into pieces and roll them in:

       Flour or corn meal

Season them with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Melt[1] in a skillet:

       Bacon drippings or butter

When the fat is hot place the fish in it. Reduce the heat slightly and
cook the fish until it is done (from 3 to 5 minutes).[2] My former cook,
Virginia Turner, taught me to completely cook one side of the fish, to
turn it, and cook the other until done. This is a very good method.

See Garnishes for Fish, page 228.

Drain them, dry them and dip each piece separately in:

     6 tablespoons thick cream

then in:

     ½ cup flour

Fry the fish in deep fat 395° for about 7 minutes (page 477). Serve the
fish with sauce. Sauté in butter (page 297):

     ½ pound Mushrooms

Prepare:

     1 cup Cream Sauce I (page 380)

     1 tablespoon lemon juice

Shortly before serving beat into the sauce, one at a time over a very
low fire:

     2 eggs

Keep the sauce hot over hot (not boiling) water. Place the fried fish on
a platter. Pour the sauce over it. Garnish it with the sautéed mushrooms
and with:

4 Servings

To clean smelts, spread open the outer gills and with the forefinger
take hold of the inner gills and pull gently; the parts unfit for food
are all attached to these inner gills and come away together, leaving
the smelt in perfect shape. Rinse thoroughly and wipe dry.

Clean:

     4 to 6 smelts

Leave them whole. Season them with:

       Salt
       Pepper
       Lemon juice

                              BROOK TROUT

4 Servings

Clean and wash: {pg 239}

     4 (8 inch) brook trout

Cut off the fins. Leave the head and tail on. Dip the trout in:

       Seasoned flour

Melt:

     ¼ cup butter

Sauté the trout in this until they are tender and nicely browned. Remove
the trout to a hot platter. Add to the drippings in the pan:

     3 tablespoons butter

Permit it to brown. Pour it over the fish. Serve them with:

       Lemon wedges
       Chopped parsley

                              FILLED FISH

This, I find, is either boiled or baked.

Scald and clean well:

       A fish weighing 2 pounds or more

Make a gash in the fish, take out the entrails and remove all bones and
meat, keeping the skin intact. Mince or grind the meat. Soak in water:

     1 cup bread crumbs

Wring the water from the crumbs. Add them to the fish with:

     ½ cup melted butter
     2 tablespoons minced parsley
    1½ tablespoons grated onions
     1 teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon pepper
       Freshly grated nutmeg

You may add:

     1 egg

Blend these ingredients lightly with a fork. Stuff the skin with the
filling and sew it together, keeping the original shape of the fish.
Place the fish in boiling salted water to cover, to which you may add
vegetables suitable for soup. Simmer the fish for about 45 minutes.
Remove it to a hot platter. You may make a sauce of the strained stock.
Thicken it by pouring part of it over 2 egg yolks, blending them well
and returning them to the remaining stock. Cook and stir the sauce over
very low heat until the eggs thicken slightly. Add:

       Salt
       Lemon juice or sherry

Or, place the fish in a baking dish, dot it generously with butter and

Add the roe and stir in:

     2 tablespoons flour
     ½ cup cream

When these ingredients are hot and well blended remove them from the
fire. Stir in:

     2 egg yolks

Season the roe well with:

       Salt
       Pepper
       Dry white wine or lemon juice

Keep it hot. Bone:

       A 3 or 4 pound shad (see Planked Fish, page 232)

Place it skin side down on a well-greased broiler rack, a flat pan or a
plank. Season the fish with:

       Salt
       Freshly ground pepper

Brush it with:

       Melted butter

Broil it gently for about 15 minutes.[1] Remove it from the oven and
spread the thin part with the creamed roe. Cover the fish with:

       Buttered cornflakes or bread crumbs

Return it to the broiler to brown evenly. Serve it at once garnished

                             BOILED LOBSTER

Allow 1 small or ½ large lobster per serving. A 2½ pound lobster will
yield about 2 cupfuls of meat. Lobster should be boiled in a large
quantity of water. Boil sufficient salted water to cover a lobster
generously. Allow:

     2 tablespoons salt or
     ⅓ cup rock salt

To:

     1 quart water

Let the water boil hard and steadily. Add, head first:

       A live lobster

If there are several, permit the water to boil again each time before
adding another. Cover the pot. Cook the lobster 20 to 30 minutes
according to {pg 241}size. Drain it. Cool the lobster quickly. It may be
plunged into cold water. Remove the claws. Crack the shells to remove
the meat from the claws. Separate the tail from the body. Draw out the
tail meat. Remove the intestinal vein. Discard it. Draw out the body
meat, remove the liver and stomach (a small hard sack near the head).
Discard them. The coral and green fat are edible (considered a
delicacy). Pick all the meat from the shell. Serve with:

       Hot melted butter or mayonnaise

Or, if you wish to serve the following baked stuffed lobster or lobster
thermidor, split the lobster and remove the meat. Discard the intestines
as directed.

To kill a lobster insert a sharp pointed knife where the tail and body
join, cutting the spinal cord. To split a lobster cross the claws, hold
them firmly and draw a pointed knife through the shell lengthwise from
head to tail with a rapid stroke. Crack the claws sufficiently to permit
the meat to be removed.

                         BAKED STUFFED LOBSTER

Split in half by the preceding rule a freshly:

       Boiled Lobster

Remove the meat. Chop it. Melt:

     ¾ tablespoon butter

Stir in until blended:

     ¾ tablespoon flour

Stir in slowly:

     ½ cup Chicken or other light Stock or Stock Substitute (page 52)

Season the sauce with:

    1¼ teaspoon dry mustard
     1 teaspoon chopped onion
       Salt
       Paprika

Melt in a separate saucepan:

     2 tablespoons butter

Sauté the lobster meat in the butter until it is heated. Add the boiling
sauce. Simmer these ingredients for 2 minutes. Remove them from the
fire. Beat:

     1 tablespoon cream
     2 egg yolks

Add these ingredients to the lobster with:

     ½ cup Sautéed Mushrooms, chopped (page 297, optional)

Fill the lobster shells with the mixture. Cover them with:

       Buttered crumbs[1] (page 300)

Bake the lobster in a moderate oven 375° until the crumbs are brown.[2]
Season it as it is removed from the oven by pouring over it:

     2 tablespoons sherry (optional)

[1] Plain bread crumbs sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese may be
substituted.

[2] The lobster may be broiled until the crumbs are brown.

                           LOBSTER THERMIDOR

This is similar to the preceding Baked Stuffed Lobster. It is not so
highly spiced and calls for cream as well as stock.

Split in halves:

     2 freshly Boiled Lobsters (page 240) (1 to 1½ pounds each)

Remove the meat as directed. Dice the meat. Melt:

     2 teaspoons butter

Stir in until blended:

     2 teaspoons flour

Add the lobster meat. Stir in slowly:

     ¼ cup rich cream
     1 cup Stock or Stock Substitute (page 52)

Simmer these ingredients for 10 minutes. Stir them frequently. Season
them lightly, if required, with:

       Salt
       Paprika
       Celery salt
       A few grains of cayenne

Remove the lobster from the pan. Add:

     1 tablespoon sherry

Melt:

     3 tablespoons butter

Add:

    1½ cups shredded white bread

Cook and stir these ingredients until all the butter is absorbed. Wash
the lobster shells thoroughly. Fill them with the lobster mixture.
Spread the tops with the bread crumbs. Place the lobster in a hot oven
400° for 5 minutes or brown the crumbs under a broiler. Serve the
lobster with:

       Marinated cucumbers

                        BROILED or BAKED LOBSTER

Split by the rule on page 240:

       A live lobster

Remove the intestinal vein, the liver and the stomach. Discard them. The
lobster may be broiled or baked, the result being much the same.

To Broil:

Glaze the lobster with:

       Olive oil

Broil it under a hot flame for 8 minutes on the flesh side, turn it and
broil it for 6 minutes on the shell side. Season it with:

       Salt

To kill a soft-shell crab stick a {pg 243}sharp knife point into the
body between the eyes.

To clean it lift and fold back the tapering points that are found on
either side of the back shell. Remove the spongy substance that lies
under them (the gills). Place the crab on its back and remove the small
piece at the lower part of the shell which terminates in a point (the
apron). All other parts of the crab are edible, including the small legs
and fins.

Wash them in several waters. Place them close together on the bottom of
a kettle with:

     ½ cup water

(Allow this amount to about 4 quarts of clams.) Cover the kettle
closely. Steam the clams until they are partly open (for about 8
minutes). Reserve the liquor. Serve the clams with individual dishes of:

       Melted butter

Add to the butter:

       Lemon juice or vinegar (optional)

This is a “bathtub dish.” The liquor is served in glasses with the clams
or it is used for clam cocktail, broth, etc.

The muscle of this shellfish is the only edible part. Some recipes call
for parboiling. Cook scallops in their own liquor until they are
thoroughly heated. Use them as you would oysters.

Or, wash and pick over:

     1 quart scallops

Drain them. Dry them between towels. Season them with:

       Salt
       Pepper

Dip them in: {pg 244}

     1 egg diluted with 2 tablespoons water

and in:

       Bread crumbs

Fry them for 2 minutes in deep fat 385°. Drain them on absorbent paper.

Scallops may be very quickly prepared. Try this way.

Dip:

       Scallops

in:

       Seasoned cream[1] or melted butter

Roll them in:

       Cornflakes or bread crumbs (optional)

Permit them to dry for about 15 minutes (not necessary but the flakes
stick better if dry). They are then ready to be sautéed in a skillet (a
very quick process calling for from 5 to 10 minutes’ cooking), or they
may be put for that same length of time in a moderate oven 375°.

I like them well heated throughout, plus a minute or two in addition,
but that’s all.

                              CANNED FISH

Salmon, crab, shrimp and tuna fish make good aspics, salads, sandwich
fillings and creamed dishes.

For “Mock Chicken” (and this is surprisingly good), place the contents
of a can of tuna fish in a colander and pour two cups of boiling water
over it.

There are creamed fish recipes to be found in the chapter on Egg and
Luncheon Dishes, and it is fun to concoct new ones. Put cooked or canned
fish into boiling cream sauce and serve it at once. Use one-half as much
sauce as there is fish. If you wish to keep creamed fish hot or to
reheat it put it in a saucepan set in boiling water. This will keep it
from being unpleasantly “fishy.”

Worcestershire sauce, curry, mustard, lemon, catsup, capers and pickles
are good additions to fish dishes.

                               Vegetables


When it comes to cooking vegetables many restaurant and hotel cooks
suffer from arrested development. Delicious meat is usually accompanied
by something indescribable that turns out to be a vegetable that has
come through a siege. It is drained of all life force and has
despairingly surrendered to the inevitable.

There are as many opinions about the best way to cook vegetables as
there are cooks, but, as in contract bridge, a few general rules have
been evolved which are safe to follow.

I. Wash vegetables, but do not soak them in water for any length of
time. If they are wilted, place them in water for a few minutes. Have a
large container with a lid on hand for the purpose of keeping vegetables
fresh. You may fit a rack into it and keep a half inch or more of water
in the bottom. Place the vegetables on the rack, cover the container and
put it in the refrigerator.

The exceptions to the rule are: cauliflower, artichokes, Brussels
sprouts and broccoli. These vegetables must be soaked in water before
they are cooked, for small insects and dust settle in them and they
cannot well be cleaned otherwise.

II. Cook vegetables rapidly in as little boiling salted water as
possible, so that when they are tender they will have absorbed all the
moisture in the pan. Add a small quantity of boiling water, if
necessary, to keep them from scorching. This method will keep their
mineral salts and vitamins from escaping. It is advisable to cook some
vegetables covered.

The exceptions are: cabbage, cauliflower, kohlrabi, onions and Brussels
sprouts. These are cooked uncovered in a quantity of boiling salted
water—one and one-half teaspoonfuls of salt to the quart. The strong
odor of these vegetables is lessened if a crust of bread is laid on top
of them as soon as they are placed in the boiling water or if a
teaspoonful of sugar is added to the water.

Young broccoli is cooked covered in boiling, salted water that barely
covers it. It may be cooked with the heads up—the stalks being boiled
and the heads steamed.

Old broccoli is cooked like cabbage.

Green corn is cooked covered in a quantity of boiling, salted water, to
which a little sugar is added. Epicures add milk in generous part to the
water. {pg 246}

Drop vegetables gradually into rapidly boiling, salted water so that the
boiling point is maintained. Quick boiling will help to retain their
color. The use of soda is to be avoided. It will help retain the color
of vegetables but it will destroy their vitamins.

III. Cook all vegetables as short a time as possible. As soon as they
are barely tender, drain them at once. If they are served with melted
(drawn) butter allow about one tablespoonful of butter to a cupful of
vegetables. Place the butter in the bottom of a pan. Melt it. Add the
vegetables. Cover the pan with a lid. Shake the pan. If they are served
with cream sauce allow one-half to one cupful of cream sauce to two
cupfuls of vegetables. See Dressings for Vegetables, page 299.

A steamer is a closed kettle with a perforated tray and a water
container. Vegetables cooked by this method are delicious and their full
flavor and food value are retained.

There is a new gadget on the market that permits a cook to scoff at
time. It is a small pressure cooker that looks like an ordinary stewpan
with a valve.

A small amount of water is placed in the pan. Food is placed on a rack
slightly above it. The handle is clamped down. The pot is placed over
heat. When the water boils, a matter of a minute or two, the food is
steamed according to directions. Asparagus or green beans are done in
fifteen seconds, lima beans or peas in one minute, delicious mealy
potatoes in eight minutes and so on.

Meats, fish and cereals are good cooked in this way and they are ready
in an unbelievably short time. Flavor and vitamins remain intact.

The hurry-up cook in possession of this steamer may serve many dishes
denied her by any other method.

There are heavy covered saucepans on the market in which vegetables are
cooked in a very little water—the so-called waterless cookers. Good
results are obtained by this method.

Excellent results are obtained by cooking vegetables in parchment. There
are a number of papers on the market that are sold in large sheets with
directions for use. A sheet is spread on the table and sprinkled like
laundry; prepared vegetables are placed upon it and salt, pepper or
paprika, cream or butter are added. The edges of the paper are gathered
up into a bag which is tied tightly and the corners are turned back to
prevent steam or water from entering the bag. It is then placed in a pan
of boiling water and when the vegetable is tender it is taken from the
bag ready to be served. This process takes a little longer than cooking
vegetables in an open or closed saucepan. Stewed fruit may be cooked in
the same way. The paper may be washed, dried and used repeatedly.
Several bags containing food may be placed in the same pan of water.
Cooking in paper has the great advantage of doing away with the scouring
of pans.

It is impossible to tell exactly how long a vegetable must be cooked in
order to be palatable—the age and the size of the vegetable being
determining factors.

Reheat vegetables in a double boiler, or place several left-over
vegetables in high narrow dishes, set them in the same pan of boiling
water and cover them with a lid. Let the water simmer until the
vegetables are hot.

The following chart, given to me by a teacher of domestic science, is a
good guide for cooking vegetables. You may differ about some of the
amounts of water and the length of cooking (I do), but that is the
privilege of the experienced cook. {pg 247}

                           CANNED VEGETABLES

Canners advise the draining of canned vegetables. The water or stock
from the can is placed over heat and boiled until it is reduced by
one-half. The vegetables are then reheated in the stock. Butter and
seasonings may be added.

Canned vegetables, drained, may be treated like any cooked vegetable.
The water from the can may be used with cream in making cream sauce. It
is also good added to homemade soup or gravy, or for diluting canned
condensed soup.

                        VEGETABLE WATER or STOCK

It is the extravagant American custom to throw away the water in which
vegetables have been cooked. This custom has been responsible for the
remark that the strongest feature of our country should be our sinks,
since so many vitamins are fed to them.

Keep a jar in the refrigerator for vegetable stock. See Stock for
Sauces, page 377. Use it as an addition to soup, gravies and creamed
dishes. Incidentally, rice water and other waters in which cereals have
been cooked are a good basis for soups and gravies.

There is a new method of cooking green vegetables that brings about very
satisfactory results. It is called the boiled in butter method.

                      BOILED in BUTTER VEGETABLES

Place in a saucepan:

       Butter[1]

Prepare for cooking, rinse and place over the butter a:

       Vegetable

Only very young, tender vegetables may be cooked whole. Slice or dice
all others except cabbage. Shred that until it is very fine. With the
hands transfer the vegetable to be cooked from the water to the
saucepan, letting the moisture cling to it. Wash:

       Large lettuce leaves[2]

Let the water cling to them. Tuck them over and around the vegetable.
Cover the pan closely. Place it over the lowest possible heat. Let the
vegetable simmer until it is tender (about the usual time allowed for
{pg 248}other methods). Uncover it only to test it. When it is tender
remove the lettuce leaves and season the vegetable with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Add to it if desired a little:

       Cream

[1] Use 1 tablespoonful of butter for every pound of vegetable weighed
before it is prepared for cooking.

                           VEGETABLE PLATTER

An attractive way of serving cooked vegetables is to place two or more
varieties on a platter in a decorative manner.

For instance, place in the center of a platter a mound of:

       New Potatoes, boiled (page 249) with drawn butter and chopped
       parsley

Place at either end:

       String Beans and Cheese (page 276) or String Beans with Egg Sauce
       (page 275)

Or place in the center of a platter a head of:

       Cauliflower with Egg Sauce (page 260)

Surround it with a ring of:

       Green Peas and chopped parsley

Surround the peas with a ring of:

       Boiled Beets (page 272) or
       Harvard Beets (page 273)

Or place in the center of a platter:

       Browned Potatoes (page 249)

Place on one end of the platter:

       Baked Onions (page 283)

Place at the other end:

In recent years the mania for girth control has played havoc with the
fair name of the potato—bringing “insinuendoes” against it that are
almost as damaging as the charges brought against the erstwhile virtue
of bread.

Time was when this highly respectable vegetable was held in great
repute. Those who have visited Hirschhorn in the sweetly romantic Neckar
Valley and who have climbed the hill to the partly ruined castle that
dominates the little village, will remember being confronted by a
“Potato Monument” dedicated piously “To God and Francis Drake, who
brought to Europe for the everlasting benefit of the poor—the Potato.”
Please don’t say that Sir Walter Raleigh or Governor Lane imported the
potato, for it really doesn’t matter, does it? {pg 249}

                         BOILED POTATOES (OLD)

4 Servings

Sprouts must be carefully removed from potatoes, as they are poisonous.

Pare and soak in cold water:

     6 medium-sized potatoes

Soak them for ½ hour in the autumn and from 1 to 2 hours in the winter
and spring. Drain them and cook them uncovered in:

     4 cups boiling water

Add:

     1 teaspoon salt

When they are done, drain them well and keep them only partly covered
(permitting the steam to escape), until ready to serve them, or place
the potatoes in a light saucepan and shake them gently over a good fire
for a minute or two. This will dry them and make them mealy. Avoid
putting them in a covered dish if you wish to keep the potatoes dry.

Mash them with a fork or a potato masher. Add to them:[1]

     3 tablespoons butter
     1 teaspoon salt
     ⅓ cup hot milk or cream

Beat them with a fork until they are creamy. Keep them hot by placing
them over hot water. A nice variation is to shape mashed potatoes into
small mounds or into one large one, make a well in the top of each
mound, place a dab of butter in each well and cover it up. Brush the
tops with:

       Milk (optional)

       Potatoes
       Onions

There should be about ½ as many onions as potatoes. Grease a baking
dish. Place the vegetables in it in alternate layers. Sprinkle the
layers lightly with:

       Flour
       Salt
       Paprika

Dot them well with:

       Butter

Nearly cover the vegetables with:

       Milk

Bake them in a moderate oven 350° until they are done (for about 1
hour).

                           SLICED POTATO PIE

6 Servings

Peel and cut into very thin slices:

     6 medium-sized potatoes

Soak them in cold water. Place them in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
Drain them, then dry them between towels. Heat a skillet. Melt in it:

Add the remaining potatoes and repeat the process. Do not stir them at
any time. Cook them over a high flame until the potatoes are brown on
the bottom—about 10 minutes. Then cover them and cook them over a low
flame until the potatoes are done—½ to ¾ hour. Dot the top with:

       Butter

Brown the potatoes on a broiler under a moderate flame for 15 minutes.
Slice them like pie and serve them.

                         FRENCH FRIED POTATOES

Konrad Bercovici tells the following story: Madame Schumann-Heink, the
great opera singer, was sitting in front of an enormous steak. Caruso
passed her table and seeing the huge portion of meat before the
{pg 255}singer, he said: “Stina, you are not going to eat that alone!”
“No,” Schumann-Heink said, shaking her fine old head. “No, not alone.
With potatoes.” Two to one, they were French fried potatoes.

Cut into lengthwise strips ¼ inch thick:

       Unpeeled[1] potatoes

Soak them in cold salted water for 1 hour. Drain them well, then dry
them between towels. Fry them in deep fat heated to 395°—hot enough to
brown an inch cube of bread in 20 seconds—until they are a golden brown
(page 477). Test a strip by pricking it with a fork to make sure that
the potatoes are done in the center. Drain them on paper. Sprinkle them
with:

       Salt

Serve them very hot.

                      CANNED FRENCH FRIED POTATOES

Canned French fried potatoes are easily reheated in a hot oven 450°.
Happily they fail to take on that worn and discouraged appearance
typical of the lunch-stand variety. Alas! they have an outstanding
drawback. A wit has said that a French fried potato is “in your mouth a
few seconds, in your stomach a few hours and on your hips the rest of
your life.”[1]

                   SOUFFLÉ POTATOES (PUFFED POTATOES)

6 Servings

The story of the discovery of Soufflé Potatoes has become legendary.

Louis XIV (diverted for the moment by his favorite pastime of fighting
the Dutch) was inspecting his army at the front. He was to dine at a
given point at a given time and a fitting repast had been prepared for
him.

His sumptuous traveling coach swinging along on its great springs (that
little palace on wheels that was the scene of so many intrigues—of so
many tender affairs) was delayed by torrential rains that made the rough
roads almost impassable.

The King was due at any moment and would undoubtedly demand food at once
to appease his phenomenal appetite. The cook was frantic. His delicious
dinner was kept hot over steam, but the potatoes, unfortunately fried
ones, were limp and cold.

A tremendous bustle heralded the arrival of the King and in despair the
unfortunate cook immersed the potatoes in hot fat for the _second time_.
Behold! there emerged the dish that was to make him rich and famous, the
twice fried potato.

“Beware the Jabberwock, my child!” In this case, avoid _red_
potatoes.[1] Choose white ones and of a discreet age at that. Pare, cut
into lengthwise slices about ¹⁄₁₆ inch thick:

     8 medium-sized potatoes suitable for baking

Soak them in ice water for 4 minutes. See rule for Deep Fat Frying, page
477. Have ready two kettles of deep fat. Heat the fat in the first
kettle to 225°. Heat the fat in the second kettle to 425°. Drain the
potato slices. Drop a few at a time into the first kettle. Fry them for
4 or 5 minutes. Transfer the partly fried slices to the second kettle,
where they should start to puff immediately. When golden brown and
puffed, drain the potatoes on unglazed paper. Sprinkle them with salt.
Permit them to cool. If they are not sufficiently crisp return them to
the hot fat for a few minutes.

                       SWEET POTATOES and APPLES

The following is an exceptionally good dish, especially with roast pork,
baked ham or a game course. It has more character than the preceding
rule for Caramel Sweet Potatoes. Perhaps I prefer it because it is tart
or because I always marvel at any cook who voluntarily dwarfs the
possibilities of a sweet potato with marshmallow. {pg 259}

Cook until nearly done in boiling salted water to cover:

     6 medium-sized sweet potatoes

Peel them and cut them into ¼ inch slices. Cook covered until nearly
done in a very little boiling water:

                              RED CABBAGE

4 Servings

This good old-timer breaks all previously given rules, for it calls for
long slow cooking in a covered saucepan. It was once a great favorite
and is now enjoying a revival of its former popularity.

A colored cook in St. Louis objects strenuously to following this or any
other cook book. Outright rebellion came at the suggestion that apple be
added to cabbage. When her mistress insisted that the rule be followed,
she left the room mumbling darkly: “That ole Mrs. Rombauer! Ought to run
_her_ out of town, that’s what _we_ ought to do!”

Pull the outer leaves from:

       A head of red cabbage

Cut it into sections, remove the hard core, shred the cabbage and soak
it in cold water. Cut into small pieces, place in a stewpan and sauté
over low heat:

     3 slices of bacon (or melt 3 tablespoons butter)

When it is well tried out remove the hard scraps of bacon. Simmer in the
fat for 3 minutes:

     2 tablespoons finely chopped onion (optional)

Lift the cabbage from the water with the hands, leaving it moist. Place
it in the stewpan, cover it and let it simmer for 10 minutes. Core and
cut into very thin slices:

     2 apples

Add them to the cabbage with:

     ¼ teaspoon salt, if bacon is used, or 1 teaspoon salt if unsalted fat
       is used
     ⅛ cup boiling water

Stir these ingredients. Cover the pan and simmer the cabbage very slowly
for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Add boiling water if required. If the water
has not been absorbed when the cabbage is done uncover the pot and
permit it to be absorbed.

Dissolve:

     2 tablespoons flour

in:

     ½ cup diluted vinegar[1]

Add:

     1 tablespoon sugar

Add these ingredients to the cabbage and simmer it 10 minutes longer.

[1] Some recipes call for 4 tablespoons of brown sugar, 4 tablespoons
undiluted vinegar and no flour. Some substitute red wine for the
vinegar.

                            CREAMED SPINACH

4 Servings

If this unfortunate vegetable—so often thrust upon resisting children
and grown-ups—were given a fair chance by the following rule it might
retire permanently from the comic papers and the vaudeville stage.

Pick over and cut the roots and tough stems from:

     ½ peck (2 pounds) spinach (when cooked 1⅓ to 1½ cups)

Wash it in several waters until it is free from sand and soil. If the
spinach is old cook it for 20 minutes in:

     1 quart boiling salted water (1½ teaspoons salt to the quart)

If the spinach is new lift it from the water with the hands and place it
moist, but without additional water, in a saucepan, cover it and cook it
for 6 minutes, or until it is tender. Drain it well. Chill it. Chop the
spinach, old or young, until it is as fine as purée, using a board and a
knife, or a chopping bowl and a knife, or put it through a coarse
strainer or ricer.[1] Melt in a skillet:

     3 tablespoons butter

Add and cook for 1 minute (or if preferred until brown):

     1 tablespoon or more very finely chopped onion (optional)

Stir in until blended:

    2½ tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

     1 cup hot cream, top milk, Stock or diluted evaporated milk

When the sauce is smooth and boiling add the spinach. Stir and cook it
for 3 minutes or until it is thoroughly blended. If the spinach seems
too thick it may be thinned with additional cream or milk. Season it
well with:

       Salt
       Paprika
       Nutmeg (very good but optional)

Serve it garnished with slices of:

     1 hard-cooked egg

The French recipes call for 1 teaspoon of powdered sugar and the grated
rind of ½ a lemon. These ingredients and the onion are optional. The
flour is sometimes browned before it is added to the butter. Evaporated
milk is good in spinach. Stock, cream or milk may be used in
combination.

Remember that young uncooked spinach makes a good salad; that cooked
buttered spinach and grapefruit salad are an ideal reducer’s luncheon;
and that cooked spinach greens are superb with Hollandaise Sauce (page
381), with crisp bacon, minced, or with Sautéed Mushrooms.

       Butter
       Salt
       Paprika

Or dispense with the cooking and merely heat the spinach. Season it and

            GREENS (Turnip, dandelion, mustard, kale, etc.)

To prepare and cook greens follow the rule on page 266 for cooking
spinach given under Creamed Spinach. Sometimes it is necessary to add a
little water. Dandelions, unless very young, may require a large
quantity of water.

“Greens” are seldom creamed, although there is no reason why they should
not be. The old-fashioned custom is to cook them to death (for an hour
or more) with bacon, salt pork or ham hocks and to serve them with
vinegar. Try the new way of short cooking. Add, after the greens are
drained (they may be chopped or put through a purée strainer), bacon
drippings and crisp sautéed bacon, minced. Lemon juice and grated onion
may be added. {pg 268}

4-6 Servings

Wash:

     2 pounds asparagus

Cut off or snap off the lower part of the stalks. It is seldom necessary
to skin green asparagus. If the asparagus is white, skin the lower ends
of the stalks with downward strokes of a knife. Tie the asparagus in
bunches. Place them upright in a deep stewpan, or in the bottom part of
a double boiler, the lower ends in:

       Boiling salted water (1½ teaspoons salt to the quart)

Let the water come to within 1 inch of the tips. Cook the asparagus
closely covered (an inverted double boiler top may be used) about 15
minutes. The steam will cook the tips. Or place the asparagus in boiling
salted water to cover, cook it covered, keep the tips out for the first
10 minutes and immerse them for the last 5 minutes.

Drain the asparagus well. Reserve the liquor. Melt:

     ⅓ cup butter

Sauté in it for 1 minute:

     1 cup bread crumbs

Pour this mixture over the tips of the asparagus or serve them with:

     1 cup Cream Sauce I[1] (page 380), Egg Sauce (page 380), or
       Hollandaise Sauce (page 381)

The ends, scrapings and the asparagus liquor may be used in making soup
(see page 49).

             BOILED CARROTS (BUTTERED or CREAMED or GLAZED)

Carrots are worthy but frequently boring. To be interesting they need
stimulating company. For good results combine them with onions, celery,
green peppers, olives, mushrooms, etc.

Carrots may be boiled, peeled, scraped or unpeeled. They may be cut into
slices, into dice, or if small they may be served whole.

Wash and scrape or merely wash:

       Carrots

Place them in a small quantity of:

       Boiling salted water

Cook them covered until they are tender. Permit them to absorb the water
in which they are cooked. If necessary add a small quantity of boiling
water. Skin the carrots if they have been cooked in their jackets.
Celery, onions, etc., may be cooked with peeled carrots or they may be
cooked separately and added later.

Serve the carrots with:

       Chopped parsley
       Melted butter, to which you may add 1 tablespoon grated cheese or
       Cream Sauce I (page 380)
     ⅓ cup sauce to 2 cups carrots or
       Green Onion Sauce (page 386)

Or, add to 1 bunch cooked carrots:

     3 tablespoons butter
     3 tablespoons sugar
     ½ teaspoon ginger or cinnamon

Simmer the carrots in this mixture until well glazed. {pg 269}

                 *        *        *        *        *

                       BOILED CARROTS in BUNCHES

Cook by the preceding rule:

       Small shapely carrots in their jackets

Cool them. Skin them. Reheat them by placing them over steam or by
sautéing them for two minutes in a little butter. Serve them in two
bunches—one at each end of a meat platter. Place at the blunt ends to
represent carrot greens:

       Bunches of parsley

A little:

       Melted seasoned butter

may be poured over the carrots.

Drain, then mash the contents of:

     1 No. 2 can turnips or about 2½ cups boiled turnips

Melt:

                              BOILED BEETS

In England boiled beets are sold from vegetable stands. Fuel is at a
premium there and the poor cannot afford to cook them in their homes. It
takes a long time to do so—four hours for the oldest inhabitants and
one hour or more for the youngsters. See Baked Sliced Beets I and II and
Beets in a Double Boiler. Beet greens may be prepared like Spinach (page
266). Add a little green coloring (optional), put the beets in a ring,
serve the greens in the center dressed with melted butter.

Cut off the tops of:

       Beets

Leave 1 inch of stem. Wash the beets. Drop them in: Boiling salted water
(1½ teaspoons salt to 1 quart water) Cook them covered until they are
tender. Add boiling water as needed. When the beets are done, cool them
slightly and skin them. Cut them into quarters, chop them or put them
through a ricer. Season them with:

       Salt

Pour over them:

       Melted butter[1]
       Chopped parsley

An improved way of boiling beets is the following. Pare and dice:

       Beets

Half cover them with:

       Boiling salted water (see above)

Cook them covered until they are tender. Add water if needed.

-----

[1] Beets may be creamed. A fine way to do this is to follow the method
for Cream Sauce I (page 380). Use orange juice and water in place of
milk. Flavor the sauce with grated orange rind. Sweeten it with 3
tablespoons brown sugar (optional). Horseradish is a good addition to
beet dressing; so is mustard or curry powder.

                              BAKED BEETS

Beets may be baked like potatoes in their jackets. Wash:

       Beets

Trim the tops, leaving 1 inch of stem. Place them in a moderate oven
325° and bake them until they are tender (for about 1 hour). Pull off
the skins. Season the beets with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Beets burn easily and smell to heaven. Having run across the following
rule, I can now serve all the beets I want without giving the household
one obnoxious whiff.

Peel, then slice or chop fine:

    16 medium-sized beets

Grease a 7 inch baking dish. Place the beets in it in layers. Season
them with:

in:

     3 cups water

Scrape and slice:[1]

       Oyster plant

and drop it at once into the water. This will prevent discoloration and
the oyster plant may be washed subsequently and will remain white. Drain
the oyster plant and cook it covered in a small quantity of:

       Boiling salted water (1½ teaspoons salt to the quart)

When it is tender drain it. Serve it with:

       Cream Sauce I (page 380—½ as much sauce as there is oyster plant)

or with:

       Melted butter—1 teaspoon butter to 1 cup oyster plant

Oyster plant may be boiled, mashed, seasoned and beaten with cream and
an egg. Shape it into cakes. Sauté them in butter.

-----

(With or without carrots)

Wash, then hull:

       Green peas

Cook them uncovered (this will preserve the color) in a very small
quantity of:

       Boiling water

Add a very small amount of:

       Salt

(It is very easy to oversalt peas.) {pg 274}There is a tradition that
one must add to peas:

       A pinch of sugar

Two or three:

       Pea pods

may be cooked with the peas for flavor. When the peas are tender drain
them if there is any water left. Season them with:

       Sautéed bacon, chopped
       Salt
       Paprika

Moisten them with:

       Melted butter or cream

                               GREEN PEAS

Peas cooked by this rule are delicious. One pound of peas unhulled is
about 1 cup of peas hulled (about 2 servings).

Wash, then hull:

       Green peas

Place them in the top of a double boiler. Cover them with large moist:

       Lettuce leaves

Cook them covered until tender over boiling water. This is sometimes a
slow process, dependent upon the size of the peas, about ¾ of an hour.
Remove the lettuce leaves. Add:

       Salt
       Paprika
       A few grains of cayenne
       Butter or cream

Serve the peas sprinkled with:

       Chopped parsley

Or, wash a head of lettuce, remove the heart. Prepare for cooking:

       Green peas

Season them with:

       Salt

Fill the head of lettuce with the peas, tie up the leaves and place the
head in a small quantity of:

       Boiling water

Steam the peas covered for 30 minutes. Serve them with:

       Melted butter or cream

The lettuce leaves may be chopped and served with the peas.

Melt in a saucepan:

    1½ tablespoons butter[1]

Add the peas and:

     1 small onion or 3 young green onions
     1 heart of lettuce
     5 or 6 sprigs of parsley
     1 sprig of thyme (optional)
     ½ teaspoon salt

Pour over them enough boiling water to cover the bottom of the pan. Cook
the vegetables over a high flame for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat
and simmer them closely covered until the peas are tender. Remove the
lettuce and the parsley. Combine, heat and pour over the peas:

Cook them (uncovered if you wish to preserve the color, covered if you
wish to preserve the vitamins) until they are barely tender—no
longer—about 20 minutes. The addition of:

       A skinned onion

gives the beans a good flavor. Drain the beans. Return them to the pot

                          JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES

It is a relief to hear that everybody is ignorant, only on different
subjects. This was one of my subjects.

Wash and scrape:

    1½ pounds Jerusalem artichokes

Drop them into:

       Boiling salted water

Cook them until they are tender.[1] Drain them. Melt:

     2 tablespoons butter

Add:

     1 teaspoon mild vinegar or white wine
     2 drops Tabasco sauce
     2 teaspoons chopped parsley

Pour these ingredients over the artichokes, {pg 289}or cream them in:

     1 cup Cream Sauce I (page 380)

-----

[1] A good vegetable with a pronounced characteristic that will bear
watching. Drain the artichokes as soon as they are tender. If permitted
to cook beyond this point they will again become tough.

                               ARTICHOKES

Soak in cold water for 30 minutes:

       Artichokes

Cut off the stems, the tough bottom leaves and ¼ of the top leaves.
Place on the stove enough water to cover the artichokes. Add:

     1 onion sliced
     2 ribs celery with leaves
    1½ tablespoons lemon juice
       Salt (1½ teaspoons to 1 quart water)

When the water is boiling add the artichokes. Cook them for 45 minutes.
Drain them and serve them hot with:

       Melted butter, mayonnaise, Hollandaise Sauce (page 381) or Béchamel
       Sauce (page 381)

Very good results are obtained by dropping artichokes that have been
soaked, trimmed and drained into boiling soup and cooking them covered
until they are tender. Unless completely immersed they will discolor
slightly, but both the soup and the vegetable will gain in flavor. If
cooked in soup pour boiling water over the artichokes to free them from
grease.

Artichokes may be served chilled. See Index.

                        STUFFED ARTICHOKES BAKED

The following excellent recipe is the contribution of my interested
Italian friends and vegetable vendors.

Soak and trim:

       Artichokes (see above)

Drain them well. Make a dressing of:

       Bread crumbs
       Garlic or onion, minced
       Chopped celery
       Anchovies, chopped, or anchovy paste
       Salt
       Paprika

Push the dressing down between the leaves. The choke may be removed by
the preceding rule, if desired, and the center may be filled with
dressing. Pour over the artichokes a little:

       Olive oil

Place them in a baking dish and cover the bottom of the dish with ¼ inch
of:

       Boiling water or Stock

Bake them covered in a moderate oven until they are done (about 1 hour).
Baste them frequently with:

       Olive oil or Stock

                            CORED ARTICHOKES

Soak and trim by the preceding rule:

       Artichokes

Dig down into the centers with a long knife or spoon and remove the
chokes. (This is rather tedious.) Tie up the artichokes with a string
and boil them as directed in the preceding rule. Drain them well, untie
them and serve them either hot or cold, the centers filled with:

       Hollandaise Sauce (page 381)

Or serve them cold, the centers filled with:

       Marinated Shrimp and mayonnaise (see “To Marinate,” page 819)

                           ARTICHOKE BOTTOMS

Remove all leaves and the choke from:

       Artichokes

Drop the bottoms into:

       Boiling salted water

to which you may add:

       Lemon juice

Simmer them until tender. Serve them with:

       Black Butter (page 300)
       Hollandaise Sauce (page 381)

Cooked or canned artichoke bottoms, well drained, may be sautéed until
hot in:

                            CORN on the COB

Remove the husks and silk from:

       Ears of green corn

Drop them, ear by ear, so as not to disturb the boiling, into a large
quantity of:

       Boiling salted water (1½ teaspoons to the quart)

Add:

     1 tablespoon or more sugar

Cover the kettle and boil the corn until it is tender (from 8 to 10
minutes). {pg 290}Remove it at once from the water and serve it. See

brown and spread them with more butter. Sprinkle them with:

       Salt

Serve them at once.

Or, after spreading the ears with butter, roll them in:

       Grated cheese

Bake in a hot oven 400° for about 10 minutes, or until the cheese is
melted.

Corn in husks may be roasted in a moderate oven 350° until tender (for
about 30 minutes). Remove husks and silk. Serve the corn with:

                            MULLED CUCUMBERS

4 Servings

The cucumber is banned from many tables as indigestible or even
poisonous. Digestion, alas! is an individual matter. Since it is said
that good judgment is the result of experience and that experience is
the result of bad judgment—why not give the cucumber the benefit of the
doubt, at least once, to see whether it has really been maligned. These
are most innocuous and very good.

Pare, seed and cut into strips:

       Cucumbers

There should be 1½ cupfuls. Drop them into:

    1½ cups boiling water

Add:

     ½ teaspoon salt

Cook them until they are nearly tender. {pg 291}Drain them well. Place
in a double boiler:

     ¾ cup Cream Sauce I[1] (page 380)

Season the sauce with:

       Salt
       Paprika
       A few grains of nutmeg (optional)

If the sauce is made with sweet milk or cream, add:

     1 teaspoon or more lemon juice

When the sauce is boiling add the drained cucumbers. Place them over hot
water and steam them for a few minutes before serving them.

Cucumbers may be cooked until tender, drained and reheated in a little
melted butter or in Tomato Sauce, page 384. They may be served au
gratin.

                       FRIED or SAUTÉED CUCUMBERS

A good garnish for a fish platter cooked by the second method. It is
traditional but totally unnecessary to soak cucumbers. If the idea
prevails that this process makes them digestible, it is a fallacy.

Pare and slice:

     3 large cucumbers

Dredge them with:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika
     3 tablespoons flour

Melt in a small skillet:

     3 tablespoons butter or bacon fat

Add and sauté until soft:

       Finely chopped onion (optional)

Add the cucumbers and sauté them until they are tender. Turn them
frequently. Or, slice the cucumbers lengthwise. Dip them in:

       Seasoned bread crumbs or flour

then in:

     1 egg diluted with 2 tablespoons of water

and again in the bread crumbs. Fry them in deep fat 390° (page 477).

                                ZUCCHINI

Zucchini are a delectable addition to the vegetable list. They are
procurable throughout the summer.

Scrub, but do not pare:

       Young zucchini

Cut them crosswise in 1 inch slices. Drop them into a small amount of:

       Boiling salted water

Cook them until they are tender (sometimes a matter of only a few
minutes). Drain them well. Pour over them a little:

       Melted butter or hot olive oil

Zucchini may be dressed with:

     2 tablespoons melted butter
     ½ teaspoon sugar
     2 tablespoons lemon juice
     ½ cup sour cream
     1 tablespoon chopped chives or other herb
       Salt

Zucchini may be boiled by this rule and creamed or they may be served
with:

       Tomato Sauce (page 384)

       Olive oil or butter

Sauté the zucchini in the oil until they are tender. Turn them
frequently. Season them with:

       Salt
       Paprika
       Sweet basil or marjoram (page 763)

Garlic or onion may be added to the oil. Serve the zucchini with:

       Hubbard or winter squash

Place the pieces in a dripping pan. Sprinkle them with:

       Salt
       Paprika
       Brown sugar or molasses
       Lemon juice (optional)

Dot them generously with:

       Butter

Cook the squash covered for ½ hour in a moderate oven 375°. Uncover it
and cook it until it is tender (for about ½ hour longer). Add butter if
necessary. Serve the squash in the shell.

Hubbard squash may be boiled or steamed. It may be baked whole.

Scrub:

       A 3 to 4 pound Hubbard squash

Place it on a rack in a moderate oven 375°. Bake it until it can be
pierced easily with a toothpick. Cut it in halves, remove the seeds.
Peel the squash; mash the pulp.

To:

     1 cup squash

add:

     1 tablespoon butter
     1 teaspoon brown sugar
     ¼ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon ginger

Beat this well with enough:

       Cream

to make it a good consistency. Place it in a serving dish. Sprinkle it
with:

       Chopped parsley
       Raisins and nut meats

          BAKED HUBBARD SQUASH with PINEAPPLE or ORANGE JUICE

Cut into halves and seed:

     1 medium-sized winter squash

Place it in a colander over boiling water. Cover the colander closely
and steam the squash until it is nearly tender. Peel it and cut it into
slices ¼ inch thick. Place the squash in layers in a greased baking
dish. Sprinkle each layer with:

       Brown sugar
       Salt
     ¼ cup crushed pineapple

Dot them with:

       Butter

Or dissolve:

     ¼ cup sugar

in:

     ½ cup hot orange juice

Add:

       Grated orange rind
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Brush the squash with this mixture. Dot it generously with:

       Butter

Bake the squash in a moderate oven for about 1 hour.

4 Servings

To be good, squash must be young and tender.

Wash, peel and seed:[1]

    1¾ pounds summer squash[2]

Cut into small pieces.

Cook it in a small amount of:

       Boiling salted water (1½ teaspoons salt to the quart)

Or (and I find this preferable) cook it covered in a strainer over
boiling water until it is tender. Drain it very well. Squash is
surprisingly watery. Mash it with a fork. Beat it until it is fluffy.
Beat in:

     1 tablespoon cream
     1 tablespoon butter
     ⅛ teaspoon pepper

Reheat the squash.

     2 tablespoons butter or drippings

Sauté in it: {pg 293}

     ¼ cup chopped onions

Add the squash. Season it with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Combine and stir:

     1 cup sour cream
     1 tablespoon flour

Bring these ingredients to the boiling point. Pour the sauce over the
squash. Serve it garnished with:

       Parsley

                 *        *        *        *        *

boiling water until they are tender. Serve them with:

       Melted butter (optional) or
       Tomato Sauce (page 384)

I have steamed medium-sized whole summer squashes (unpeeled and
unseeded) and have served them without seasoning or butter with
excellent results. They may be served with tomato or other sauce. There
are endless ways of preparing this palatable vegetable. Be sure to

                 ACORN SQUASH BAKED (DES MOINES SQUASH)

This useful vegetable is fairly new in our markets. Baked or boiled, it
resembles a sweet potato, but retains the squash flavor.

On her way to a luncheon a friend stopped to market. Later she
telephoned home to give her cook the dinner menu. “And,” she added,
“cook the acorn squash by some rule in the _Joy of Cooking_.” “Squash?”
said the maid. “Them’s eggplant.” “No,” said her mistress, “acorn
squash, and cook them by Mrs. Rombauer’s directions.” After dinner she
complimented the maid on the unusual quality of the squash and asked:
“By what rule did you prepare them?” The answer was prompt and
triumphant: “By Eggplant I.”

Cut into halves and remove the seeds from:

       Small acorn squashes

Rub them inside and out with:

       Butter

Season each half with about:

     ⅛ teaspoon salt
       A sprinkling of paprika
     ½ teaspoon brown sugar (optional)

Bake them in a moderate oven 375° for 45 minutes or until done. Place a
pan containing a little water on the lower grate.

Squash may be parboiled and baked or boiled until tender and seasoned
after being boiled. Squash may be boiled and stuffed with squash. In
that case treat the squash used for stuffing like mashed potatoes. They
may be topped with crumbs and butter or cheese and reheated under a
broiler. Acorn squashes are good baked or boiled until nearly tender,
seasoned, cooled, filled with a soufflé mixture and baked in a moderate
oven 325° for about 25 minutes.

I have served the squash filled with Tomatoes Creole (page 188) with
great success. See page 207 for further suggestions.

It is hard to give the amount of spinach as the squash varies so much in
size. Fill the hot squash cups with the spinach. Garnish them with:

       Slices of hard-cooked egg or strips of pimiento[1]

This vegetable is fairly new in our markets. Treat it much as you would
zucchini or other squash.

Pare and cut crosswise[1] in ¾ inch slices:

     1 pound chayote

Boil:

     ½ cup water
     ¾ teaspoon salt

it. Dress it with:

       Butter
       Black butter (page 300), etc.

                       BAKED or BROILED EGGPLANT

I once heard an artist say: “If {pg 295}only the eggplant were as good
as it looks, what a gastronomic treat it would be.”

There are several ways of preparing this vegetable that make it taste
almost as luscious as it looks. The old-fashioned manner of dipping it
in batter and frying it in deep fat has given way to newer ones, of
which the baked eggplant recipe which follows is a good example. Besides
being digestible, non-fattening and exceedingly good, it is very quickly
prepared.

Pare:

       An eggplant

Cut it crosswise into slices ½ inch thick. Spread the slices on both
sides with:

       Soft butter

Season them with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Place them on a baking sheet and bake them in a quick oven 400° until
they are tender, turning them once (approximate time 12 minutes).

Or, broil them until they are tender under a moderate flame. If feasible
finish broiling them under a steak where they can catch the drippings.
Serve the eggplant while it is very hot with:

       Lemon Butter (page 390, optional)
       A sliced lemon or Tomato Sauce (page 384)

                 *        *        *        *        *

This is luscious.

Prepare the preceding:

       Baked Eggplant

Omit the butter. Marinate the slices for 15 minutes in:

       French Dressing

Bake or broil them as directed.

                   EGGPLANT with ANCHOVIES and CHEESE

Prepare for cooking by the preceding rule:

       An eggplant

Spread the slices on both sides with a mixture of:

     3 tablespoons butter
     2 tablespoons anchovy paste

Sprinkle them with:

     1 cup grated cheese

Bake on a greased sheet in a hot oven 400° until tender (for about 8
minutes).

                  STEAMED and SAUTÉED EGGPLANT SLICES

Peel and cut crosswise into slices 1 inch thick:

       A medium-sized eggplant

Place the slices in a colander over boiling water. Cover them closely
with a lid. Steam them for 20 minutes. Season them with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Sauté them for 1½ minutes on each side in:

       Drippings or butter

or dip them in:

     1 egg diluted with 2 tablespoons water

Dip them in:

       Bread crumbs or corn meal

and sauté them as directed until they are light brown.

                       SAUTÉED or FRIED EGGPLANT

There is a superstition that an eggplant must have the juice pressed
from it. All old recipes read: “Slice, salt and weight an eggplant.” I
wonder why, when it is so good without all that bother?

Peel and cut in ¼ inch slices:[1]

       An eggplant

Dredge it with:

       Flour

Season it with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Sauté it slowly in a little:

       Butter or oil

Or, dip the seasoned and floured eggplant in:

     1 egg diluted with 2 tablespoons water

then in:

       Seasoned bread crumbs

Fry the slices in deep fat 370° (page 477). If preferred the slices may
be dipped in batter (page 478).

Place layers of eggplant and layers of crumbs in a baking dish. Season
them if the crackers are unsalted with:

     ¼ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika

Have the top layer of crumbs. Pour over these ingredients:

     ½ cup milk

Place on the top:

       Thin slices of cheese or grated cheese (optional)

Bake the eggplant in a moderate oven 375° for ½ hour. Serve it with:

       Sautéed Bacon (page 338)

                  EGGPLANT SOUFFLÉ I with CREAM SAUCE

In the following recipes the pulp is scooped out of the center of the
eggplant. It is combined with various ingredients and is replaced in the
eggplant shells, in which it is then baked and from which it is served.

Cut into halves an:

       Eggplant

Scoop out the center, leaving a shell ¼ inch thick. Cook the pulp in:

     6 cups boiling salted water

Add to the water:

     ½ tablespoon vinegar

When the pulp is tender drain it and mash it with a fork. There should
be about 1 cupful of pulp. Melt in a saucepan:

     3 tablespoons butter

Stir in until blended:

    2½ tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

                        MUSHROOMS—HOW TO PREPARE

Mushrooms are now found in the market for the greater part of the year
at a low cost. They form an acceptable addition to the everyday menu,
frequently taking the place of meat.

To prepare mushrooms, brush them with a brush or wipe them with a cloth
and separate the cups from the stems. If they are washed, dry them
thoroughly. When young and fresh they need not be skinned. When old pull
off the capskins with the fingers or with a knife and pare the stems
with a knife. To mince, break the caps into pieces and slice the stems
with a knife. If the stems are tough use them for stock and save all the
skins and parings for this purpose.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                             MUSHROOM STOCK

Place in a saucepan:

       Mushroom skins and ends

Add:

       Onion
       Celery ribs and leaves
       Carrots
       Parsley

Cover these ingredients with:

       Cold water

Simmer them for 30 minutes. Strain the stock. Season it when ready to
use it with:

       Salt
       Paprika

                 *        *        *        *        *

                           SAUTÉED MUSHROOMS

Prepare for cooking:

     1 pound mushrooms (see above)

Melt in a skillet:

     2 tablespoons butter

(The skillet may be rubbed with a clove of garlic.) Add the mushrooms
and:

     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Sauté them quickly until they are done (4 or 5 minutes). Shake the
skillet or stir the mushrooms. When the mushrooms are well coated reduce
the heat to a moderate flame. Bacon fat may be substituted for butter.
In that case use less salt. Sautéed mushrooms are surprising things. At
first they are so dry you think they will burn, then they relieve your
fears suddenly by becoming pleasantly moist. {pg 298}

       A pinch of herbs[2] (optional)

-----

[1] Sour cream may be used. Finely chopped onion may be sautéed with the
mushrooms. So may a bit of garlic (remove this before preparing the
sauce).

                     CHESTNUTS—HOW TO PREPARE THEM

Make two crosscut gashes on the flat side of each chestnut with a sharp
pointed knife. Sometimes the shell will come off while doing this, but
the inner skin will protect the kernel. Place the nuts in a pan over a
quick fire, dropping oil or butter over them—1 teaspoonful to 1 pound
of nuts. Shake them until they are coated, then place them in a moderate
oven until the shells and skins can be removed easily.

Or, place chestnuts in cold water to cover. Bring it to the boiling
point and boil the nuts for 5 minutes. Drain them and remove the shells
and skins.

Or, place chestnuts in cold water to cover. Bring the water to the
boiling point, then boil the chestnuts for 30 minutes. Plunge them into
cold water. Remove the hulls and skins. The nuts should be sufficiently
tender to be put through a purée strainer. If not, cover them with
boiling water and cook them until tender.

                            BAKED CHESTNUTS

Prepare by the first or second rule above:

     3 cups chestnuts

Season them with:

     2 tablespoons or more brown sugar (optional)

Grease a baking dish. Place the chestnuts in it. Pour over them:

    1¾ cups Chicken Stock

Cover them and cook them in a slow oven 325° for 3 hours. Pour off the
stock. Melt:

     2 tablespoons butter

Stir in until blended:

     1 tablespoon flour

Stir the stock in slowly. When the sauce is smooth and boiling pour it
over the chestnuts and serve them.

                            BOILED CHESTNUTS

Shell and skin:

     1 pound chestnuts (see above)

Drop them into:

       Boiling salted water

Cook them until they are tender. Drain them well. Mash them with:

     1 tablespoon butter
       Salt if needed
     ¼ teaspoon pepper

Add:

     2 or more tablespoons hot milk

Beat the chestnuts until they are fluffy. Keep them hot over hot water.
Immediately before serving them stir in:

     1 cup or more finely diced raw celery (optional)


                        Dressings for Vegetables

Drain cooked vegetables. Be careful not to overcook them. I like my
vegetables with enough spirit left to fight back, also with their
individual flavors intact.

Use a little imagination in dressings. The great favorite is drawn
(melted) butter. To this you may add lemon juice, grated onion, garlic,
celery salt, nutmeg, grated lemon or orange rind, paprika, salt, chives,
parsley or other herbs (page 763), curry powder, mustard, Worcestershire
or chili sauce, grated cheese, horseradish, etc.

Vegetables are fine in black butter—butter that is cooked until it is
dark, to which vinegar or lemon juice is then added. Grated onion may
{pg 300}be sautéed in the butter, or chopped parsley may be added just
before serving.

Next in popularity come buttered crumbs. To butter crumbs, allow
one-third cupful of melted butter or bacon drippings to one cupful of
crumbs. Sauté the crumbs until well blended. To these you may add onion,
grated cheese, curry powder, paprika, etc.

Then comes the creamed vegetable. Prepare Cream Sauce I (page 380). You
may use milk or part cream and part vegetable stock. You may beat an egg
yolk into a cup of sauce, return it to the heat, stir and cook it gently
until it has thickened slightly and pour it over a vegetable. This sauce
is good flavored with lemon juice. It is particularly good over
asparagus and green beans. See Allemande and Béchamel Sauce (page 381).
If you wish to cream a watery vegetable—cauliflower, cabbage,
etc.—drain it well and add it to boiling cream sauce, or pour very hot
cream sauce over it. If you do not take this precaution the sauce may
become too thin.

Vegetables au gratin: Creamed vegetables frequently are served with a
bread crumb top crust (au gratin). Spread dry bread crumbs over a cooked
vegetable. Dot the top with butter. You may sprinkle it with grated
cheese. Place the vegetable in a hot oven 400° or under a broiler until
the cheese is melted.

You will find a variety of dressings given under the recipes for
vegetables. Here are several others I hope you will try out.

                                  Meat


                           Amount to Purchase

One pound boneless meat equals 4 servings. Boned meats include:
{pg 304}flank steaks, rolled roasts, tenderloin, liver, heart, kidneys,
sausages, brains, sweetbreads, and most canned meats.

One pound meat with a small amount of bone equals 3 servings. Round
steak, rib roast, pot roast, ham slices.

One pound meat with a large amount of bone equals 2 servings. Most
steaks, shoulder steaks, shoulder cuts, short ribs, neck chops, breast,
plate, brisket.

                  Rule for Keeping and Preparing Meat

Keep meat cold and at an even temperature. Unwrap it as soon as it is
brought into the house. Place it in an open dish, loosely covered with
oiled paper, in the refrigerator. Clean it by wringing a cloth out of
cold water and wiping the meat thoroughly. Dry it with a cloth, trim off
the hard edges and the surplus fat. Permit it to stand until it is at
room temperature. It is then ready to be cooked.

                        Rule for Seasoning Meat

There is a diversity of opinion about this. Salt toughens meat but it
helps bring out the flavor. On the whole the tendency is to season meat
before cooking or after searing it. Allow three-fourths teaspoonful of
salt to one pound of ground meat, one teaspoonful to one pound of solid
meat.

A clove of garlic may be tucked in near the bone of a leg of lamb; a bay
leaf may be added to roast pork; and a skinned onion may be placed in a
corner of the pan when roasting meat.


                  The Modern Method for Roasting Meat

This is today the generally accepted manner of roasting meats and fowl.
As there are a few people who fail to advance with the times or who,
being otherwise progressive, hanker nostalgically for the roasts
{pg 305}that mother used to make, a chart for roasting by the
old-fashioned method is appended.

Prepare a roast for cooking by the above rule. Take it from the
refrigerator at least one-half hour before roasting it.

Place the meat in a pan, fat side up, in a preheated oven (see the
following chart). Do not increase or decrease the heat at any time. Add
no liquid. Do not cover or baste the meat. Make gravy with part of the
pan drippings and Vegetable Stock (see page 378).

It is impossible to give an absolutely accurate timetable for roasting
meat, as too many factors are involved, such as the lean and the fat,
the shape, the size and the quality of the roast. A meat thermometer is
essential for absolute accuracy. Insert the bulb of the thermometer in
the center of the lean part of the meat. Be sure that it does not rest
upon either fat or bone. Make a gash in the meat with a pointed knife or
a skewer in order to facilitate the insertion of the thermometer.

VEAL   ............................     300°       25 to 30     170° F.

For a small roast, allow the longer period of cooking. For a large roast
allow the shorter period of cooking.

-----

[1] Hams which are specially processed for tenderness require shorter
cooking time. These hams should be cooked to a lower internal
temperature (150°—160° F.), allowing 20 to 22 minutes per pound. See
Ham, page 333.

Fillet of beef is treated in a different manner (see the rule on page
308).

A rolled roast will require 5 to 10 minutes longer per pound.

If you wish to brown a roast after it is cooked, place it under a
broiler for a few minutes.

There is a preference among some cooks for a previously seared roast.
This method is old-fashioned and optional. If you wish, try it out to
determine whether you prefer it.

Place the roast in a very hot oven 500°. When lightly browned, after
about 20 minutes, reduce the heat to a slow oven, 300° (see chart) and
continue roasting it until done. Allow the shorter amount of time for
these roasts, including the time for searing. See Timetable for Roasting
Meat. {pg 306}

For gravy for all roasts see page 377.

The less tender cuts of meat may be improved by being placed for several
hours in a marinade.

                     Marinade for TENDERIZING MEAT

Combine:

     1 cup French dressing with garlic
     1 tablespoon mixed dried herbs or
     2 tablespoons mixed, chopped fresh herbs—parsley, chives, basil,
       savory, etc. (optional)

      A General Rule for Roasting Meat by the Old-Fashioned Method

Prepare the meat as directed in the rule on page 304. Place it in a pan
on a dripping rack in a very hot oven 480° to 500° F. until it is
browned. Reduce the heat to a moderate oven 350°, pour a cup of boiling
stock over the roast and cover the pan. Cook the roast until it is done,
basting it frequently. It may be uncovered for the last half hour. If
stock is not available for basting meat use Vegetable Stock. See the
paragraph on Gravy (page 377).

A roast of beef is sometimes seared in a pan on top of the stove until
light brown on all sides and then placed in a 350° oven as directed.

Fillet of beef comes under a different rule (see page 308).

                      Timetable for Broiling Meat

This calls for quick heat. Preheat a broiler. Grease the rack. Place
meat on it.

Place the top of a one inch steak or chop 2 inches from the source of
heat.

Place the top of a two inch steak or chop 3 inches from the source of
heat.

While broiling the meat leave the door of the broiling oven open. Broil
until the top side is well browned; season with salt and pepper.

Turn and broil until the second side is browned. Only one turning is
necessary. Season the second side and serve the meat on a hot platter.

Broiling time depends upon thickness of the meat and the degree of
doneness desired. Approximate length of time for broiling is as follows:

STEAKS, 1 inch thick.................................. 12 to 15 minutes
   “    2 inches thick................................ 30 to 35 minutes
LAMB CHOPS, ¾ inch thick.............................. 10 to 12 minutes
HAM SLICE, 1 inch thick............................... 20 to 25 minutes

                           To Pan-Broil Meat

See Pan-Broiled Steak, page 311; Lamb Chops, Pan-Broiled, page 327; Pork
Chops, page 330.

                             To Braise Meat

The less tender cuts of meat are frequently braised. See Marinade on
this page. Dredge meat with flour (optional). Season it. Brown it
quickly in a very little fat—the fat of the meat, rendered, hot butter,
{pg 307}lard, oil or drippings. Place it in a heavy kettle. Add enough
boiling water or stock to cover the bottom of the pot (about ¾ cupful).
Cover the pot closely. Simmer the meat on top of the stove until it is
tender. Add stock if required.

Or dredge, season and brown the meat. Pour over it 2 to 4 cups of
boiling water or stock, cover the pot closely. Place it in a slow oven
250° for 3 or 4 hours. Baste it every 30 minutes. Turn the meat once, at
about the middle of the cooking period.

Vegetables, pared and quartered, may be added to braised meat, either
when halfway done or later. Carrots, turnips, parsnips, onions, celery,
tomatoes, etc. are good for this dish.

                   Meats Usually Prepared by Braising

 Beef pot roasts                     Lamb shanks, breast and neck slices
 Swiss steak                         Beef tongue
 “Country fried” steak               Beef liver
 Flank steak                         Beef heart
 Veal shoulder steaks or chops       Oxtails
 Pork shoulder steaks and chops

                              To Stew Meat

Have the meat cut into small uniform pieces. Season them with salt and
pepper. They may be dredged with flour. Brown the meat on all sides in a
small amount of fat—the fat of the meat, rendered, butter, lard, oil or
drippings. Onion or garlic may be added to the fat. Half cover the meat
with boiling water or stock. Permit the liquid to come to the boiling
point, then reduce the heat to a low flame. Cook the meat (covered)
_very slowly_. In other words, simmer it, _do not boil it_—temperature
185°. Approximate length of time for stewing is as follows:

 BEEF............................... 40 to 60 minutes to the pound
 MUTTON............................. 20 minutes to the pound
 VEAL............................... 25 minutes to the pound
 CHICKEN............................ 20 minutes to the pound

Add pared vegetables for the last 30 or 45 minutes of cooking, long
enough to have them tender—sliced carrots, turnips, celery, parsnips,
tomatoes, etc. For gravy see the chapter on Gravy (page 377).

Stews may be baked covered in a slow oven 300° to 325° after the meat
has been immersed in the stock. In that case it may be necessary to add
more stock during the cooking.

                               Fricassées

These are really stews. It is customary to brown the meat before stewing
it, or to stew it until tender, brown it in butter or fat and return it
to the stock or gravy.

                  To “Boil” Ham, Corned or Fresh Beef

A misnomer, for these meats are never “boiled.” They are simmered
covered until tender.

Cover meat with water. It should be completely covered so that all of it
is cooked at the same temperature. Season it with salt and pepper
{pg 308}if required. Spices and herbs or vegetables may be added for
flavor. Cover and simmer the meat until done—20 to 30 minutes per pound
for ham, 15 to 25 minutes per pound for new-type tendered ham, 45
minutes per pound for picnic shoulder, and 40 to 50 minutes per pound
for corned beef or fresh beef. Do not boil the meat at any time.

Add pared vegetables to the pot for the last 45 or 30 minutes of
cooking, long enough for them to be tender.

                            To Barbecue Meat

Barbecued meat—lamb, pork, beef, fowl—is usually cooked in the open
very slowly and for a long time over a pit of coals. It is basted with a
highly seasoned sauce. To barbecue meat indoors, place it in a hot oven
500° for 20 minutes, reduce the heat to 300° and begin basting it with
Barbecue Sauce (page 386). Baste it frequently throughout the cooking
period, which may be as much longer as you like than the time given in
the Timetable for Roasting Meat (page 305). The sauce is served,
unthickened, with the meat.


                                  Beef

The best cuts of beef for roasting are the rib and loin. The round,
cross arm, rump, chuck, ribs and clod may be roasted, but as these cuts
are less tender than the rib and loin, it is better to braise or to
pot-roast them. See Marinade (page 306). Neck, shoulder, shank, brisket,
plate, flank and the heel of the round may be either stewed or braised.

Tender steaks—porterhouse, sirloin, T-bone—are best either broiled or
pan-broiled; less tender steaks—round, rump, etc.—are better braised.

                               ROAST BEEF

Remove from the refrigerator at least ½ hour before preparing for
cooking:

       A rib or sirloin roast of beef

Wash it with a damp cloth. Trim off the excess fat and hard edges.
Season the roast with:

       Salt
       Pepper

Its surface may be rubbed with:

       A cut clove of garlic

and it may be dredged with:

       Flour

Place the roast fat side up in a pan in an oven preheated to 300°. If
the roast is very lean tie or skewer over it:

       A piece of suet or salt pork

Cook it as directed by the rules and timetable for roasting meat on page
305, 18 to 30 minutes to the pound. A rolled roast will require 5 to 10
minutes longer to the pound.

Note that a roast may be browned in a hot oven 500° for 20 minutes
before being cooked, uncovered, and without basting in a moderate oven
300°. If you wish to brown a roast after it is done place it under a
broiler for a few minutes. Use the fat and drippings in the pan for
making Gravy (see page 377). Serve the roast with:

       Noodle and Apple Dish (page 100), Yorkshire Pudding (page 377) or
       Tomato Pudding (page 185)

See the Chart for Left-over Food (page 766) for recipes utilizing
left-over roast.

                      FILLET or TENDERLOIN of BEEF

Allow ⅓ lb. per serving

A fillet of beef, being deliciously tender of its own accord, calls for
a slightly different method of cooking than other meat.

Remove the surplus fat and skin from:

       A fillet of beef

Lard it with narrow strips of:

       Salt Pork or Bacon (page 818)

Fold over the thin ends of the fillet and secure them with string or
skewers. If the fillet is not larded spread it generously with butter or
place strips of bacon over it. Season it with:

       Salt
       Pepper

Dredge it with: {pg 309}

       Flour

Place it on a rack in a roasting pan in a very hot oven 500°. Place a
piece of salt pork or bacon in the bottom of the pan. Bake the fillet
from 20 to 30 minutes only (according to its size). A fillet of beef
prepared as directed, may be roasted in a slow oven 325° from 20 to 25
minutes per pound. Do not cover or baste it.

_Gravy, page 377._

This is good made with:

       Pan drippings and sour cream

Add to the gravy:

       Sautéed Mushrooms Minced (page 297)

or surround the fillet with:

       Broiled Mushrooms (page 298)

Garnish the platter with dabs of:

       Tart jelly on slices of orange
       Sprigs of parsley
       Mashed Potato Balls (page 251)

                               POT ROAST

Beef shoulder, chuck, blade bone, boneless neck and rump make good pot
roasts.

Wipe with a damp cloth:

     3 pounds chuck or other beef

The meat is improved by being larded with:

       Salt pork or bacon

Rub the meat with:

       Garlic (optional)

Season it with:

       Salt
       Pepper

Dredge it with:

       Flour

Heat in an iron pot over a hot fire:

     2 tablespoons fat

Sauté lightly in the fat:

     ¼ cup chopped onion

Remove the onion. Sear the meat on all sides in the fat until it is dark
brown. Pour over it:

     2 cups or more of boiling stock, Vegetable Stock (page 378) or 1 cup
       of stock and 1 cup canned tomatoes

There should be about ½ inch of liquid in the pot. Reduce the heat and
cover the pot closely.[1] Do not boil the meat at any time. Simmer it
slowly until it is done (for 2 or 3 hours). Add stock if the roast
becomes dry. Remove the roast from the pot. Strain the stock and thicken
it with:

       Flour[2] (see Gravy, page 377)

Vegetables may be cooked and served in the stock. About 1½ cupfuls in
all of green pepper, celery, carrots, parsley, potatoes, etc. Peel and
slice them or grind them and add for the last half hour or so of
cooking. Serve the pot roast with:

       Noodles (page 98) or
       Dumplings (page 374)

-----

[1] Pot roast may be baked covered in a slow oven 300° to 325° after the
stock has been poured over it.

[2] Some cooks like a sour sweet gravy. You may get this effect by
adding 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1½ tablespoons lemon juice, acid wine or
vinegar.

     2 small onions, sliced
     ¼ teaspoon ginger
     3 cloves
     ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
     2 tablespoons sugar

Follow the above rule for Pot Roast. Soak the meat for 12 hours in the
cider. Keep it in a cold place, turn it once. Use the cider in place of
the hot Vegetable Stock.

Follow the rule for Pot Roast. Substitute for the vegetable stock:

     2 cups boiling water

Add after 1 hour of cooking:

     2 cups cranberries

And additional boiling water if needed.

This is like a good pot roast. It comes in a very little sauce.

Place on an oven-proof plate the contents of:

     1 can roast beef (340 grams)

Heat it in a hot oven 400° for about 10 minutes. Prepare and serve with
it:

8 Servings

Dice and heat in a skillet over a low fire until the fat is tried out:

     4 cubic inches of salt pork

Cut into cubes or slices:

     2 pounds beef (an inexpensive cut)

Brown the meat in the fat. Sear it on all sides. Place the meat in a
casserole. Add:

     ½ cup peeled and diced carrots
     ¼ cup peeled and diced turnips
     ¼ cup peeled and diced onions
     ¼ cup peeled and diced celery

Rinse the skillet with:

     2 cups boiling water

Add:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon paprika

Pour it over the meat and vegetables. Cover the dish closely. Bake the
meat in a slow oven 250°. Baste it every half-hour. Turn it after 2
hours. Bake it until it is tender—for about 3½ hours. Thicken the
drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

Add if needed:

       Seasoning

                             BEEF À LA MODE

This is similar to Sauerbraten (see below), but the meat is marinated
for about 18 hours. Mr. Julian Street suggests a marinade of:

     1 quart astringent red wine (zinfandel)
     1 bay leaf per 5 lbs. meat
       Herbs and seasoning

After marinating, follow the rule for Pot Roast, page 309. Substitute
the marinade for the stock. Heat but do not boil it.

10 to 12 Servings

Wipe with a damp cloth:

     3 pounds beef shoulder

Lard it with pieces of:

       Salt pork or bacon

(or choose a cut of meat with fat).

Rub it with:

       Garlic (optional)
       Salt
       Pepper

Place it in a crock or bowl. Heat but do not boil:

       Equal parts of mild vinegar or white wine and water
     ½ cup sliced onion
     2 bay leaves
     1 teaspoon peppercorns
     ¼ cup sugar

Pour this while hot over the beef so that it is more than half covered.
Place a lid over the crock and put it in the refrigerator. Leave the
meat there for a week or ten days, turning it once a day. Drain it,
saving the vinegar, and cook the meat like Pot Roast (page 309). Use the
vinegar mixture in place of stock. When the meat is tender remove it
from the pot. Thicken the stock with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

Add:

     1 cup sweet or sour cream

I like the gravy “straight.” Some cooks add raisins, catsup and
gingersnaps, but I have never had the courage to do so. Serve the roast
with:

       Potato Dumplings (page 375)

and you will have a treat.

                             BROILED STEAK

Prepare for cooking (page 304):

       A Beefsteak 2 inches thick[1]

Preheat a broiler thoroughly. Grease it. Place steak on the center of
the broiling rack so that the top of the steak will be about 3 inches
from the heating element (See Timetable for Broiling Meat, page 306).
Leave the door of the broiling oven partly open. When the steak is well
browned on one side, season it with salt and pepper and turn it. When
the second side is browned the steak will be done. Season the second
side and serve the steak immediately. A steak 1½ inches thick requires
20 to 25 minutes for broiling; a steak 2 inches thick requires 30 to 35
minutes. A very thick steak may be browned on both sides, then cooked
until done under a lowered flame. When it is done spread it with:

       Butter

Serve it garnished with:

       Sautéed Mushrooms (page 297)
       French Fried Onions (page 284)

-----

[1] You may rub the steak with a cut clove of garlic. You may spread it
an hour before it is cooked with olive oil. Add, if desired, grated
onion and prepared mustard. Or you may spread it when ¾ cooked with
French dressing or with a paste made of soft butter, grated onion and
prepared mustard. Or you may serve it with:

       Sauce for Steak (page 386), Marchand de Vin Sauce (page 387) or
       Green Onion Sauce (page 386)

                           SAUCE for STEAK II

This may be prepared while the {pg 311}steak is being broiled.

Heat:

     2 tablespoons steak drippings or butter

Sauté in the fat for 5 minutes:

     ¼ cup finely chopped onion

Add:

     ½ teaspoon mustard
     1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon pepper
     ½ cup boiling water

Cover these ingredients and simmer them for 10 minutes. Shortly before
serving the steak, strain the sauce and pour it slowly, beating it
constantly, over:

     1 beaten egg

Stir and cook the sauce for 1 minute over low heat. If desired stir in
the steak drippings. Pour the sauce over the steak. See Sauces (page
386).

     3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
     6 tablespoons olive oil
     3 tablespoons catsup
     3 teaspoons sugar
     3 teaspoons salt

Brush part of this over the meat. Broil it (see above) ¾ to 1 hour. The
heat may be reduced for the last ½ hour of cooking. Leave the door of
the broiling oven partly open. Turn the steak once. Brush it frequently
with the remaining liquid.

                           PAN-BROILED STEAK

Prepare for cooking:

       A Beefsteak (page 304)

Heat a frying pan over a good flame until it is smoking hot. Rub it very
lightly with:

       Suet

Put the steak in the pan and sear it for 1 minute, turn it and sear the
other side. Season the steak with:

       Salt
       Pepper or paprika

Reduce the heat to a low flame and continue cooking the steak until it
is done, about 10 minutes for a 1½ inch steak. Pour off the fat in the
pan. If it is allowed to accumulate the steak will be sautéed and not
broiled. If at all doubtful of the tenderness of the steak partly cover
it with a lid when the flame is reduced. This gives it more of a steamed
than a broiled quality but it does help to soften it. The drippings may
be thickened with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

or the preceding rule for Sauce may be followed. Serve the steak with:

       German Fried Potatoes (page 254)

Sauté sufficient:

       Onions (page 283)

to cover the steak. Prepare the following sauce. Combine:

    1½ cups tomato juice
     1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
     2 tablespoons diced ham
     1 tablespoon butter

Simmer these ingredients for 10 minutes. Combine:

                          FILLET of BEEFSTEAKS

Upon request a butcher usually will cut fillet steaks, shape them and
surround them with a strip of bacon secured by a bit of wood. If not, it
must be done at home. The thickness of the steaks varies from ¾ of an
inch to 1 inch or more.

Prepare for cooking:

       Fillet steaks[1] 1 to 2 inches thick

Follow the Timetable for Broiling Meat, page 306. Spread the steaks,
while hot, with:

       Butter or Hollandaise or Béarnaise Sauce (page 381, 382)

Serve them on a hot platter garnished with:

       Lemon
       Parsley
       Broiled Mushrooms (page 298)
       Mashed Potato Balls, Fried (page 251)

8 Servings

This seems best when cooked a day ahead, but it is fine at any time.
Perhaps I think that because it is frequently served by a well-known
hostess at her country parties. It is a one-dish meal.

Cut into small pieces:

     ½ pound salt pork

Cut into pieces suitable for stewing:

     2 pounds beef

Sauté the pork in a large skillet over a slow fire. Brown the meat in
the drippings over a quick fire. Sprinkle it with:

     1 tablespoon flour
     1 teaspoon salt
     ½ teaspoon pepper

Combine and heat until boiling:

    1½ cloves garlic, chopped
     1 large onion, chopped
     1 bouillon cube dissolved in 1 cup hot water
     8 ounces canned tomato sauce
    12 pepper corns
     3 whole cloves
     ¼ cup parsley, chopped
     ½ bay leaf

Place the meat in a Dutch oven. Pour the above ingredients over it.
Simmer it covered for about 4 hours. After 3 hours add:

     ½ cup sherry or acid white wine

Cook separately until nearly tender:

     6 medium-sized potatoes, peeled and quartered
     6 carrots, peeled and quartered
     1 stalk celery, chopped

Add these vegetables for the last 15 minutes of cooking.

Add to it: {pg 315}

     ½ cup sliced onions
     ½ cup sliced carrots
     ½ cup sliced celery with leaves
     ½ teaspoon salt

Pour over these ingredients boiling water to cover. Cover the pot and
simmer the meat until it is tender (for 3 or 4 hours). Prepare the
following:

Sauce

Melt:

     4 tablespoons butter

Brown lightly in the butter:

     ¼ cup chopped onions

Stir until blended:

     2 tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

     2 cups pot liquor
     ½ cup freshly grated horseradish[1] or prepared horseradish

Season the sauce with:

       Salt
       Sugar
       Vinegar or lemon juice

Cut the meat into slices. Reheat it in the boiling gravy.

Serve the dish garnished with:

       Chopped parsley

Serve the beef with:

       Boiled New Potatoes in their jackets (page 249)

-----

[1] The matter of seasoning is optional. The original recipe calls for 1
cup pot liquor, 1 cup horseradish, 1 cup cider vinegar and ½ cup of
sugar. This seems excessive to me. I substitute a cup of pot liquor for
the vinegar, then flavor the sauce as I like. Prepared horseradish
contains vinegar, so it is difficult to give exact proportions.

                             GOULASH (BEEF)

6 Servings

This Hungarian dish is made in many different ways. Beef, veal and other
meats are used separately and in combination. Vegetables are sometimes
added for the last hour of cooking. Goulash is always highly
spiced—epicures insisting that one form of pepper (peppercorns freshly
ground) is the requisite, others preferring the imported Rosen Paprika
or some other spice. Some cooks use a very little water, others prefer
stock, sour milk, cream or red wine. This is a good general rule:

Wipe with a damp cloth and cut into 1 inch cubes:

     2 pounds round steak, shinbone or other beef or 1 pound beef and 1
       pound lean veal

Melt in a heavy pot:

     4 tablespoons butter or fat

Sauté in this:

    1½ cups chopped onion

Add:

     1 teaspoon salt
     ½ teaspoon pepper or 1 teaspoon paprika

Brown the meat in the fat. Add:

     1 cup or less boiling Stock (page 50) or tomato juice

The amount of boiling liquid used is another moot point. Some use just
enough to keep the meat from scorching and add more gradually during the
cooking. Cover the pot closely and simmer the meat for 1½ hours. If the
larger amount of liquid is used, 6 small peeled potatoes may be added
for the last half-hour of cooking, but they do soak up the gravy and the
gravy is apt to be the best part of the goulash. Remove the meat from
the pot and thicken the stock for:

       Gravy (page 377)

It may be necessary to add stock or tomato juice. Add if required:

       Seasoning

Serve the goulash with:

       Polenta (page 110), Spaetzle (page 376) or Noodles (page 98)

5 Servings

These are good—so good that one need not hesitate to serve them at any
time. Grind:

     1 pound round steak or shoulder, etc.

Add:

     ¾ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon paprika
     ¼ cup chopped onions (optional)
     2 tablespoons thick cream (optional)

Work the meat lightly with the hand. Shape it loosely into five cakes
about 1 inch thick. Surround each cake with:

       A strip of bacon[1]

Secure the bacon with a toothpick. Heat a frying pan. Brush it very
lightly with bacon grease. Brown the patties on both sides in the hot
pan. Reduce the heat and cook them slowly until they are done. Serve
them with:

       Scalloped Potatoes and Onions (page 253)
       Brown Sauce (page 385)

-----

[1] The use of bacon is optional. If it is omitted sauté the patties in

       Sautéed Mushrooms (page 297); chopped pickles, celery or olives,
       herbs or capers, etc.

Serve cooked hamburgers with:

       Onion Soup Sauce (page 393)

(This may make you an isolationist.) Or add to the pan drippings:

     3 tablespoons lemon juice
     ⅛ teaspoon nutmeg

Or spread the steaks with:

       Finely chopped olives or chives mixed with butter

                     HAMBURGER STEAK BALLS or CAKES

4 Servings

Combine lightly with a fork: {pg 317}

     1 pound ground round steak or shoulder
     ¼ pound ground salt pork
     3 tablespoons rich milk
     ¼ teaspoon celery salt
     ¼ teaspoon salt
     1 tablespoon or more chopped onion[1]
     1 tablespoon chopped parsley or other herb
     ¼ teaspoon paprika

You may vary these seasonings by adding:

     1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
       or
     1 or 2 teaspoons prepared mustard
       or
     2 teaspoons horseradish, drained

Shape the meat into balls. Handle them very lightly so that they will
not become too solid. You may flatten them into cakes and surround the
cakes with:

The following is a good way of preparing meat for a convalescent or a
young child.

Scrape with a spoon or a dull knife:

       Round steak

Season the scraping with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Roll them into a ball, flatten it slightly and pan broil it in a hot
skillet that has been rubbed with a very little:

       Butter or suet

Sear the meat on both sides over a good flame, reduce the heat, turn the
meat several times, dotting the upper side each time with a very little:

       Butter

Serve the meat on:

                              BEEF LOAF I

4 to 6 Servings

Here are two good recipes for beef loaf. The first calls for an egg yolk
and bread crumbs; the second for ground vegetables, cracker crumbs and
canned tomatoes. Beef loaf is good baked in a ring mold. Pour about ½
cupful of catsup in the bottom of a greased ring mold. Fill the mold,
cover it with a piece of buttered paper. Bake the loaf as directed.
Invert the mold. Serve the ring filled with green peas or any other
vegetable. If the loaf is served cold fill it with potato or some other
vegetable salad. Two tablespoons of chili sauce may be poured over the
top of a meat loaf when it is half cooked. This gives it a good flavor
and a light crust.

Combine and shape into a loaf:

     1 pound of ground beef (¼ this amount may be pork)
     1 egg yolk
     2 tablespoons chopped parsley
     1 tablespoon butter
     1 tablespoon bread crumbs (optional)
     1 teaspoon lemon juice
     1 teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon pepper
     ½ teaspoon onion juice

Wrap the loaf in waxed paper and place it in a pan. Bake it in a
moderate oven 350° for 1 hour. Pour over it and baste it every 5 minutes
with:

     ¼ cup butter
     1 cup boiling water or Vegetable Stock (page 378)

Thicken the drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

Serve the loaf with:

       Sweet Potato Puffs (page 258)

8 to 10 Servings

Grind:

     3 large peppers
     1 large onion

Add:

     1 cup cracker crumbs or lightly crushed cornflakes

Drain, reserving the juice: {pg 318}

    3½ cups tomatoes (No. 2½ can)

Combine the vegetables and add:

     1 pound ground beef
     1 pound ground pork
     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika

Shape these ingredients into a loaf. Dredge it with:

       Flour

Cover it with:

     5 or 6 slices of bacon

Bake the loaf for 1 hour in a moderate oven 350°. Baste it frequently
with:

       Tomato juice

Remove it from the pan. Thicken the drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

If there is insufficient tomato juice add:

       Vegetable Stock (page 378) or Stock Substitute (page 52)

Serve the loaf with:

       Riced Potatoes (page 250)

               BEEF À LA LINDSTROM I (SWEDISH MEAT BALLS)

6 Servings (about 18 one and a half inch balls)

There are many rules for this dish all similar to, and in my opinion
none superior to, the recipe on page 162 for:

       German Meat Balls[1]

Follow this rule. Shape the meat into 1½ inch balls.

Brown them in:

     1 tablespoon butter or drippings

Simmer them closely covered until they are done (for about 15 minutes)
in:

     2 cups consommé or other Stock

Thicken the stock with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)[2]

Reheat the balls in the gravy. Serve them with:

       Potato Dumplings (page 375)

     4 large carrots
     1 medium yellow turnip
     1 stalk celery

Add these ingredients to the roast for the last half hour of cooking.

                                  Veal

Veal requires longer cooking than beef. It is always served well done,
except abroad, where it retains a luscious pink color. It may be kept
juicy by having a generous coating of fat rubbed into its surface. This
also gives it a fine brown color.

Cook veal uncovered at a low even temperature 300°. Do not sear veal
roast at any time. It may be dredged with flour. Several strips of salt
pork or bacon may be placed on the roast or in the pan and the roast, if
dry, may be basted with the drippings. Roast veal 25 to 30 minutes to
the pound. A shoulder roast or rolled roast may require a few minutes
longer per pound.

Cuts for Roasting: Kidney roast or rib, leg, loin, breast, shoulder,
cushion shoulder and rolled roast. {pg 321}

Cuts for Braising or Roasting: Chuck, round bone, rolled shoulder,
shoulder, blade bone shoulder and rump roast.

Cuts for Stews: Shoulder, breast, knuckles, shanks, flank and kidneys.

                 VEAL ROAST STUFFED BREAST or SHOULDER

Have a pocket cut in:

       A breast or shoulder of veal

Remove it from the refrigerator at least ½ hour before preparing.

Wipe the meat with a damp cloth. Fill the pocket with:

       Bread Dressing (page 369), Oyster Dressing (page 370) or other
       dressing (about 3 cupfuls)

Sew it up with a coarse needle and thread. Season the meat with:

       Salt
       Paprika

If it is not fat rub it with:

       Butter[1]

Dredge it with:

       Flour

Place it in a roasting pan in a slow oven 300°. Bake it uncovered until
it is done (25 to 30 minutes to the pound). See rule above or chart on
page 305. You may place on the roast several strips of:

       Bacon

Thicken the drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

                          BREADED VEAL SLICES

The following Veal Slices are so delicate that they may be served as a
company dish in preference to some more costly meat course.

Wipe with a damp cloth and trim the edges from:

     2 pounds veal steak from the round ¾ inch thick

The meat may be rubbed with:

       Garlic

Pound the meat well with the edge of a plate and cut the surface lightly
with crisscross gashes. Cut the meat into pieces the size of a large
oyster. Season them well with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Dip them in:

       Bread crumbs

then in:

     1 egg diluted with
     2 tablespoons water

and again in the crumbs. Heat in a skillet:

       Butter

Brown the slices in the butter over a quick fire. Half cover the slices
with:

     1 cup cream and ½ cup Stock or Stock Substitute (page 52)

Cover the skillet with a lid. Reduce the heat to a very, very low flame,
or place the covered skillet in a slow oven 325°. Cook the meat for 1
hour. Thicken the drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

The following variation meets with great favor:

Stone and drain:

       Queen Anne cherries

In the place of all cream use ⅔ cream and ⅓ cherry juice. Cook the
stoned cherries in the gravy with the meat for the last 5 minutes, or
cook the meat as directed and add to the stock 5 minutes before the meat
is done:

     1 cup of seedless grapes or peeled and seeded white grapes

                 *        *        *        *        *

     ½ cup or more sliced onions

Brown the meat in the fat. Add:

     ½ cup sour cream[1]

Cover the skillet and cook the veal over a very low flame until it is
tender (about ½ hour). Thin the drippings with:

       Boiling Stock or Stock Substitute (page 52)

Sprinkle the Schnitzel with:

       Lemon juice

                               VEAL STEW

Wipe with a damp cloth:

    1½ pounds of veal

The meat may be cooked in one piece or it may be cut into 1¼ inch cubes.
Melt in a heavy pot or saucepan over a quick flame:

     3 tablespoons butter or drippings[1]

Sear the meat in the drippings. Reduce the heat to a very low flame,
cover the bottom of the pot to the depth of ½ inch with boiling:

       Vegetable Stock[2] (page 378)

Cover the pot closely and simmer the meat until it is tender (for 45
minutes or more).

Remove the meat from the pot. Strain the stock. Thicken the stock with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

Return the meat to the pot, heat it and serve it sprinkled with:

       Chopped parsley

-----

[1] The browning of the meat in fat is optional. For a pleasant change
drop it directly into boiling vegetable stock and cook it as directed.

[2] One-half cupful sliced onions may be sautéed in the fat and boiling
water may be substituted for stock. Celery, carrots, turnips, etc., may
be peeled and cubed and added to the gravy for the last hour of cooking
or the vegetables may be ground and added. A good proportion is:

    1½ pounds of veal
     1 cup carrots
     1 cup onions—small whole onions skinned or sliced onions
     1 cup potatoes

If vegetables are added do not strain the stock. Thicken it if required
with:

     1 or 2 tablespoons of quick cooking tapioca or flour combined with a
       little water (see Gravy, page 377)

Cook the tapioca in the gravy for 5 minutes. Stir it from time to time.
Cook and stir the flour until it thickens. Serve the stew with: {pg 323}

       Noodles (page 98), Farina Balls (page 77) or Rice Ring (page 102)
       and Fried Apples (page 398)

                 *        *        *        *        *

Veal stew is very good with a baked top crust. Follow the rule for
Chicken Pot Pie Crust (page 143) or serve it in Corn-Meal Mush Pie (page
155) or Grits Ring (page 156).

6 Servings

An American version of Blanquette de Veau[1]—an inexpensive and very
good main dish.

Cut into 2 inch squares:

    2½ pounds veal shoulder

Place in a saucepan and bring slowly to the boiling point:

     4 cups cold water
     6 ribs celery with leaves, chopped
     4 sprigs of parsley
     1 bay leaf
     2 cloves
     ½ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon white pepper
     ⅛ teaspoon grated nutmeg
     ½ teaspoon thyme (optional)

Drop the meat piece by piece into the pot. Do not check the boiling of
the stock. Reduce the heat. Simmer these ingredients covered until the
meat is tender (for 45 minutes or more). Add for the last half hour of
cooking:

     8 or 10 small onions, peeled

Remove the meat and the onions from the pot. Place them where they will
keep hot. Strain the stock. Skim it. Melt:

     3 tablespoons fat or butter

Stir in until blended:

     3 tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

     2 cups stock

Add, if needed:

       Salt
       Paprika

Cook and stir the stock until it is smooth and boiling. Remove it from
the heat. Beat in:

     3 beaten egg yolks

Stir the gravy over a low flame to permit the yolks to thicken slightly.
Remove it from the fire. Beat in:

     3 tablespoons lemon juice or sherry

Arrange the meat and the onions on a platter around a mound of:

       Boiled Rice (page 100)

Pour the gravy over the meat. Place at each end:

       A bunch of parsley
     6 or 8 cooked whole Carrots (page 269)

Serve it at once.

-----

[1] Blanquette de Veau is soaked in water for 1 hour. It is put on in
cold water which is skimmed frequently. It is boiled, not simmered, for
45 minutes. The result is a fine gravy, but meat that is robbed of
nearly all flavor. I prefer the dish as given.

                               VEAL BIRDS

Wipe with a damp cloth and trim the edges from:

       Slices of veal from the round ⅓ inch thick

Pound the meat with the edge of a plate and cut it into pieces of about
2 × 4 inches. Make the following dressing:

Chop the meat trimmings and combine them with an equal amount of
chopped:

       Salt pork

Measure the salt pork and trimmings and add to them ½ the amount of:

       Bread crumbs

Add:

       Chopped onion[1]
       Chopped celery
       Salt
       Pepper

Moisten these ingredients with {pg 324}enough:

       Cream or Stock or Stock Substitute (page 52)

to hold them together. Spread the meat lightly with the dressing and
roll it. Secure it with skewers or thread. Sprinkle the birds with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Roll them in:

       Flour

Sauté them in:

       Butter

over a quick fire until they are brown. Reduce the heat and add:

       Hot cream or milk

until the birds are half covered. Cover the pot closely and cook them
until they are tender (for about 20 minutes).

Thicken the drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

Pour it over the meat.

For a more simple way of making veal birds follow the rule for Beef
Rolls (page 313).

In place of the dressing the meat may be rolled around small sausages or
sausage meat.

                            Lamb and Mutton

Lamb is a tender meat. All cuts may be roasted. The best-known cuts for
roasting are a quarter of spring lamb, leg, crown roast or rack, loin,
shoulder or chuck, rolled shoulder, cushion shoulder and breast. The
leg, shoulder and breast may be stuffed. Other cuts may be braised or
stewed. The thriftier cuts are square cut shoulder and cushion shoulder.
Mutton is lamb grown-up. Its flavor is a bit strong, so it is boiled or
stewed more frequently than roasted, in this country. You may substitute
mutton for lamb in any of the following recipes. Allow 5 to 10 minutes
longer per pound for cooking it.

                               LAMB ROAST

Remove from the refrigerator at least a half-hour before cooking:

       A piece of lamb

Wipe it with a damp cloth. Season it with:

       Salt
       Pepper

Dredge it with:

       Flour

You may cut narrow gashes in the sides with a skewer and place in them:

       Slivers of garlic

Place the lamb, fat side up, in a pan in a slow oven, preheated to 300°.
Roast it as directed by the chart on page 305, 30 to 35 minutes to the
pound.[1] Do not cover it or baste it. Thicken the drippings with:

       Flour[2] (see Gravy, page 377)

Add to it:

       Sour cream or milk (optional)

Serve the roast with gravy and:

       Mint Sauce (page 389)

If mint sauce is not desired see:

       Currant Jelly Sauce (page 386)

-----

[1] The roast will be well done, according to our American custom.
Europeans like it rare.

[2] In many homes it is traditional to serve lamb and mutton gravy
without thickening.

See the chart for Left-over Food (page 766) for ways of utilizing
left-over lamb.

       Salt
       Pepper

Dredge it with:

       Flour

Place the roast uncovered in a slow oven 300°. Allow 30 to 35 minutes to
the pound. Remove the roast before the last hour of cooking. Fill the
center with:

       Bread Dressing or Dressing for Crown Roast of Lamb (page 373)

Return it to the oven and complete the cooking. Remove the covering from
the bones. Garnish them with a paper frill, a slice of pickle or a
stuffed olive. Thicken the drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)
       (See Currant Jelly Sauce, page 386)

An unfilled crown roast may be cooked upside-down. Omit covering the
bones when roasted. Fill the hollow of the roast with:

       Buttered Peas (page 274)

                                  Pork

The first rule for pork is that it must be thoroughly cooked. Avoid
“pink pork”—cook the meat until it is white or grayish. Bake it
uncovered in a 350° oven 30 to 35 minutes to the pound.

Any part of pork may be roasted. The choice roasts are the rib, loin and
shoulder. The lower half of the foreleg (picnic) may be boned and rolled
or flattened and stuffed.

Fresh hams, or legs of pork, are good roasted or braised.

                               PORK ROAST

Take the roast from the refrigerator at least a half-hour before cooking
it. Wipe it with a damp cloth and cut off the edges and surplus fat.
Season the roast with:

       Salt
       Pepper

It may be rubbed with a cut clove of garlic. It may be dredged with:

       Flour

Place it, fat side up, in a pan in an oven preheated to 350°. Cook it 30
to 35 minutes to the pound (see chart on page 305). Thicken the
drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

Serve the pork roast with:

       Applesauce (page 398)
       Sweet Potatoes and Apples (page 258)
       Apple and Onion Dish (page 192)
       Noodle and Apple Dish (page 100)

A rib roast may be boned, stuffed, rolled and cooked by the above
method. Cooked prunes and apricots are sometimes used for the dressing.

                          CROWN ROAST of PORK

Prepare like Crown Roast of Lamb (page 325):

       A crown roast of pork

Place it in a moderate oven 350°, allow 30 to 35 minutes to the pound.
Remove the roast 1 hour before it is done. Combine:

    2½ pounds pork sausage[1]
     ½ cup bread crumbs
     ¼ cup chopped onions
     ½ cup chopped celery

                           ROAST SUCKLING PIG

This recipe for the old-fashioned way of cooking a young pig is given
because it is pleasant to preserve traditional rules. However, there is
no reason why you should not dress and season a pig and roast it
throughout in a moderate oven 350°, allowing 30 to 35 minutes to the
pound.

Dress, by drawing, scraping and cleaning:

       A suckling pig

Wash it well. Dry it inside and out. The dressed pig should weigh about
12 pounds. Rub the inside with:

     1 tablespoon salt

Fill the pig with:

       Dressing

Onion dressing is traditional, but choose your favorite kind, page 369.
It takes 2½ quarts of dressing to stuff a pig of this size. Multiply all
your ingredients but not the seasonings. Use these sparingly until the
dressing is combined, then taste it and add what is lacking. Sew up the
pig. Put a block of wood in the pig’s mouth to hold it open. Skewer the
legs into position, pulling the forelegs forward and the hindlegs
backward. Rub the pig with:

       A cut clove of garlic (optional)
       Salt
       Oil or soft butter

Dredge it with:

       Flour

Cover the ears with pieces of well-greased paper. Secure them with paper
clips. Place the pig in a pan in a hot oven 480° for 15 minutes. Reduce
the heat to a moderate oven 350°. Roast the pig until it is tender,
allow 30 minutes to the pound. If you wish the surface of the roast to
be soft baste it every 15 minutes with boiling:

       Stock or Stock Substitute (page 52), use about 2 cups

If you wish it to be crusty baste it every 15 minutes with:

       Oil or melted butter

and dredge it with:

       Flour

It may be sprinkled very lightly each time with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Remove the paper from the ears for the last 30 minutes of baking. Place
the roast on a platter. Remove the wood from the mouth. Replace it with
a small:

       Lemon, apple or carrot

Place in the eyes:

       Raisins or cranberries

Place around the neck a wreath of:

       Small green leaves

or garnish the platter with:

       Parsley or watercress

The pig may be surrounded with:

       Cinnamon Apples (page 397), Apples filled with Sweet Potatoes (page
       259), Apples filled with mincemeat, Baked tomatoes filled with
       pineapple, etc.

Serve the roast with:

       Gravy

made with the pan drippings or the liquid in the pan (page 377).

                       PORK ROAST with SAUERKRAUT

Have the butcher remove the bones from:

       A pork shoulder

Sprinkle the meat inside and out {pg 330}with:

       Salt
       Pepper

Fill the shoulder with:

       Sauerkraut, drained

Dredge it with:

       Flour

Follow the rule for Roast Stuffed Shoulder of Lamb (page 326). If there
is no dripping rack available, put ½ cup of water in the pan to keep the
roast from sticking or see Modern Method of roasting Meat, page 304.

self-explanatory name) it is well to allow one pound of ribs to a
person. Buy the meat in two strips.

Wipe with a damp cloth:

     2 pieces of spareribs

Spread one piece with a dressing made of:

     1 cup bread crumbs

                                  Ham

In former years ham required soaking in cold water to cover for twelve
hours or more. Modern methods permit us to dispense with this step, but
it is advisable to soak home-cured hams for six hours or more.

A “boiled” ham should be simmered, never boiled. Allow 30 minutes per
pound for simmering a medium-sized ham; allow slightly more for a
{pg 334}small ham and slightly less for a large ham. A thermometer will
register 160° when the ham is done.

For a ham that is to be “boiled” and then baked, allow 25 minutes’
simmering to the pound for a medium-sized ham, and slightly more for a
small ham and slightly less for a large ham. A thermometer will register
150° when the ham is ready to be baked.

                         HAM, BOILED and BAKED

Scrub well:

       A smoked ham[1]

Place it in a kettle of fresh simmering water that barely covers it.

Add:

       Vegetables suitable for soup
     1 bay leaf
     8 peppercorns
     6 allspice (optional)

Simmer the ham. See the preceding rule. Permit it to cool partly in the
water in which it was cooked, drain it and strip off the skin. Cover the
top of the ham with:

       Brown sugar
       A little dry mustard (optional)

Stud it with:

       Whole cloves

Bake the ham in a hot oven 425° for 20 minutes.

Baste it with a choice of:

     1 cup cider, pineapple or orange juice, the juice of pickled peaches,
       cooked prunes or apricots, wine, ginger ale or molasses

Dredge it with:

       Brown sugar

Sprinkle it with:

       Grated orange rind

Lower the heat to 350°. Cook it without basting for 30 minutes. For the
last 15 minutes put into the pan:

       Pineapple slices

Garnish the ham with the pineapple and:

       Maraschino cherries
       Parsley

Serve it with:

       Raisin Cider Sauce (page 387), Sour Cream and Horseradish Sauce

              “COUNTRY” HAMS (Virginia, Smithfield, etc.)

It is a custom in some parts of the United States to “hang” hams for a
long period of time. They become old and even moldy before they are
used. This means that they must be thoroughly scrubbed with a brush and
rinsed before being soaked. Yellow soap may be used when necessary to
remove the mold.

After cleaning the ham soak it overnight in cold water to cover. Rinse
it and follow the above rule for Ham, Boiled and Baked. Allow 30 minutes
to the pound for boiling an old ham. Bake it as directed above.

Scrub well:

       A smoked ham

Bake it on a rack uncovered in a slow oven 325°. Allow 25 minutes to the
pound[1] for ½ a ham, 30 minutes for a whole ham. Take the ham from the
oven 1 hour before it is done. Remove the rind, all but a collar around
the shank bone.

Combine:

    1⅓ cups brown sugar
     2 teaspoons dry mustard
     ⅓ cup fine bread crumbs

Moisten these ingredients with:

     3 tablespoons cider vinegar, prune juice, wine or ham drippings

Spread them over the fat side of the ham. Cut diagonal gashes across the
fat side of the ham in diamond shape. Stud the fat with:

       Cloves

Return the ham to the oven for 45 minutes. Increase the heat to 425°.
Bake the ham 15 minutes longer. Place the ham on a platter. Garnish it
with:

       Maraschino cherries or cranberries

Surround it with:

       Pineapple slices[2]

or:

       Apple Cups Filled with Sweet Potatoes (page 397)

It may be served with: {pg 335}

       Wine Sauce (page 387) or some other sauce for ham (see Sauces, page
       387)

                       NEW PROCESSED HAMS, BAKED

Hams, processed for tenderness now purchasable everywhere, require no
soaking or boiling. Directions for cooking them are usually given on the
wrapper. See that the ham is at room temperature, unwrap it and wipe it
with a damp cloth. Replace it in the paper[1] in which it was wrapped.
Place the ham, fat side up, in a pan in a slow oven 300°. Bake it as
directed, usually 20 to 22 minutes to the pound. (Internal temperature
when done 150° to 160°.) One-half hour before the cooking time is over,
remove the ham from the oven, unwrap it, score it, stud it with cloves,
etc., as suggested in the last part of the above rule for:

       Ham, Boiled and Baked, or
       Baked Ham

Return it to the oven for the last half-hour of cooking. Baste it
frequently for the first 15 minutes.

                    SLICE of HAM, BAKED or SIMMERED

This is one of the finest everyday dishes I know, but I find it
curiously neglected by most cookbook writers.

There are two methods of preparing a ham slice—with scarcely a
preference for one or the other method, so that becomes a matter of
convenience.

Ham is prepared, covered with other ingredients and baked until done
(covered or uncovered) in a moderate oven 350°. Or it is seared, covered
with other ingredients and simmered (covered or uncovered) on top of a
stove until done. The ingredients added are so varied that it is
impossible to list them all, but any one of them seems to result in a
good dish.

                     HAM, BAKED or SIMMERED in MILK

4 to 6 Servings

Trim the edges of:

       A small slice of smoked ham 1¼ inches thick

Stud the fat with:

     3 or more cloves

Combine:

     3 tablespoons brown sugar[1]
     2 teaspoons prepared mustard

Rub these ingredients into both sides {pg 336}of the ham. Sear it on
both sides over quick heat in:

       A little fat

Pour around it:

     ½ cup rich milk[2]

Cook the ham covered in a moderate oven 350° for about 45 minutes. Bake
it uncovered for the last 10 minutes. Baste it frequently. Add hot milk
if needed.

Or prepare by the above rule:

       A slice of ham ½ inch thick

Sear it. Reduce the heat. Simmer the ham covered on top of the stove for
about 10 minutes. Uncover it for the last 3 minutes. Test the ham,
whether baked or simmered, for doneness. There are now so many
differently prepared hams on the market that it is difficult to give the
exact time.

This is a very practical thing to have on hand. It keeps for a long
time, there is no waste and one is ready on short notice to make a
deliciously flavored sandwich.

Place in boiling water to cover:

     1 pound or more Canadian bacon

Simmer it until it is tender—for about 1 hour. Remove it from the

                                 BACON

When Charles Dickens honored us with his famous American tour he
ventured into the wilds around St. Louis. There he stopped at a country
inn where the waitress asked him if he would have “the white bread and
chicken fixings or the corn bread and common doings?” Upon inquiry, I
have found the latter to be bacon.

Place on a fine wire broiler or rack in a dripping pan:

       Strips of bacon

Bake them in a moderate oven 350° until the bacon is crisp and brown or
place bacon in a cold skillet and cook it slowly until it is done. Pour
off the drippings while cooking the bacon to insure crispness. Turn it
frequently.

Bacon may be dredged, before it is cooked, in:

       Corn meal

   Sweetbreads, Brains, Kidneys, Liver, Heart, Tongue, Oxtails, etc.

                              SWEETBREADS

Soak in cold water for 20 minutes:

       Sweetbreads

Drain them well. Place in a kettle sufficient water to cover the
sweetbreads but do not place the sweetbreads in it at this time. Add to
the water:

     2 tablespoons lemon juice
     2 or 3 ribs of celery with leaves or sprigs of parsley
     ¼ cup chopped onion
     ½ teaspoon salt
       A few peppercorns

Bring the water to the boiling point. Drop the sweetbreads into it,
lower the heat and simmer them for 20 minutes. Drain them. Reserve the
stock. Place them in cold water to harden for 15 minutes. Drain them and
remove the skin and membrane. The sweetbreads are now ready to be
creamed, broiled, etc.

The liquid in which the sweetbreads were cooked makes an acceptable
stock. If you wish, more vegetables may be used in the making of it. The
vegetables may be cooked until they are tender after the sweetbreads
have been removed. The stock may be flavored with:

       A beef cube

It may be used strained or unstrained. It makes a good aspic in which to
mold the sweetbreads (see Aspic Salads, page 420) and is useful in
making Braised Sweetbreads (see below), etc. {pg 340}

       sweetbreads)

The sauce may be made with stock and cream. Just before serving add:

       Sherry (1 tablespoonful to 1 cup sauce)

                 *        *        *        *        *

                          SAUTÉED SWEETBREADS

minutes. Remove the lid. Pour over the sweetbreads additional stock
thickened with:

     1 or 2 teaspoons flour[2]

Cook them uncovered until the bacon is done. Baste them frequently. Add
to the gravy for the last 2 minutes of cooking:

       Sherry or lemon juice (optional)

-----

[1] The stock may be the water in which the sweetbreads were cooked.
Finely minced carrots and celery may be added to the boiling stock and
cooked in it until tender and sautéed mushrooms may be added when the
vegetables and stock are thickened with flour. This is a luxurious and
delicious touch, but not a necessary one, to a very good dish.

[2] Only a small amount of gravy is required.

                              CALF BRAINS

Calf brains are generally in bad repute. They are charged with being too
soft, but properly treated they become palatable and there are several
good ways of preparing them. They combine well with other food—eggs,
salads, soufflés, ragout, etc.—and need only a little pep in
flavor—sherry, Worcestershire sauce, etc.—to make them very good.

Soak in cold water for 1 hour:

       Calf brains

Remove the membrane and cook the brains like sweetbreads (page 339). Put
them into cold water to harden for 15 minutes. Drain them and break them
into pieces. Calf brains may be substituted for or combined with
sweetbreads. They make a delicious soufflé. In fact their flavor is—to
use an overworked word—intriguing. Add a set of calf brains cooked by
the above rule to 4 eggs before they are scrambled (see Scrambled Eggs,
page 85) or serve the Brains Creamed and sprinkled with Chopped Parsley
with Omelet (page 89).

Clean them and dry them between towels. Cut them in two, lengthwise.
Season them with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Roll them in:

       Corn meal or flour[1]

Melt in a skillet:

       Butter or bacon grease[2]

Cook the brains on each side for about 3 minutes. Cover them, reduce the
heat and complete the cooking—about 15 minutes in all. Serve them with
a choice of:

       Lemon wedges
       Tomato or Worcestershire sauce
       Black Butter (page 300)

Thick slices of tomato may be sautéed in the same pan. Add bacon
(sautéed previously) to these, and you have a fine meal.

Veal, lamb, mutton, beef and pork kidneys are used. Preference is
usually given the first two; all are good.

Allow 1 veal, 2 or 3 lamb, 1½ to 2 mutton, ½ beef and 1 small pork
kidney per person. Cook kidneys as short a time as possible. Long
cooking tends to make them tough.

Add slowly, stirring constantly:

     1 cup Stock or Stock Substitute (page 52) or consommé

When the sauce is smooth and boiling season the kidneys with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Remove them from the fire. Add: {pg 343}

     2 tablespoons sherry or Madeira

Serve hot on:

                              BEEF KIDNEYS

Beef kidneys must be washed or scalded, skinned and if old, soaked in
salt water (1 teaspoonful of salt to 1 quart of water) from 2 to 3
hours. You may change the water 2 or 3 times. Remove some of the fat,
split the kidneys lengthwise and cut out the white center and tubes.
Kidneys may be placed in a marinade (see page 306) for several hours, or
they may be parboiled for 5 minutes. They are then ready to be broiled,
stewed and if sliced again, pan-fried.

                            BEEF KIDNEY STEW

4 Servings

This is a contribution—the favorite recipe of a family who likes this
dish for Sunday breakfast.

Select:

     2 small kidneys (or 1 beef and 1 veal kidney)

Soak them for 1 hour in cold water. Drop them into boiling, unsalted
water to cover. Simmer them until tender. Remove the kidneys from the
stock. Cool them. Place them in a covered dish in the refrigerator (not
necessary, but preferable). Reserve the stock. When the kidneys are
chilled, cut away the fat and membrane. Cut the meat into wafer thin
slices. Remove the fat from the stock. Add to the stock:

     1 bay leaf
       A few drops of brown coloring

Simmer it gently. There should be about 1 cupful. You may add to flavor
it:

     1 beef or vegetable cube

Melt:

     1 to 2 tablespoons butter

Sauté the kidneys lightly in the butter. Stir in:

    1½ to 2 tablespoons flour

Pour the strained stock onto this and stir the gravy until it is smooth
and boiling. Flavor by adding:

     1 slice of lemon or
     2 tablespoons sherry
       Salt and paprika as needed

Serve the kidneys on:

       Toast

Garnished with:

       Chopped parsley

                 *        *        *        *        *

                           CREOLE KIDNEY STEW

4 Servings

Prepare for cooking by the rule on this page then cut into ½ inch
slices:

     2 medium-sized beef kidneys

Sprinkle them with:

     ¼ cup flour

Sauté slowly until light brown:

     2 slices bacon, minced

Add:

     2 tablespoons drippings or butter

Brown the kidney slices in the fat with:

     ½ cup chopped onions
     ½ cup coarsely chopped celery

Simmer covered for 10 minutes, then heat and add to the above:

     1 No. 2 can tomatoes
     1 green pepper, seeded and shredded
     1 teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon red pepper
     ⅛ teaspoon curry powder (optional)

Cover the pan, simmer the stew for about 15 minutes. Stir it frequently.
Serve it with:

       Rice or Noodles or on toast

                 *        *        *        *        *

                              KIDNEY STEW

4 Servings

Follow the preceding rule. After browning the kidneys, onions and celery
cover them with: {pg 344}

     2 cups boiling water or Stock or Stock Substitute (page 52)

Omit the tomatoes and all that follows. Simmer the stew covered for
about 15 minutes. If too thin the stock may be thickened with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

Season it as desired and flavor it with:

       An herb
       Sherry or Worcestershire sauce

                                 LIVER

Calf liver is the most desirable, but beef, lamb and pork liver may be
used.

Remove membranes. Wash liver with a wet cloth or in cold water. Keep it
whole or slice it. If you wish to sauté beef liver it is wise to place
the slices in salt water (1 teaspoon salt to 1 quart of water) for 1
hour, or to parboil them for 5 minutes. Dry the liver, then proceed with
any of the recipes given for calf liver.

                             SAUTÉED LIVER

A quick process, a matter of two or three minutes in all. Remove the
skin and veins from:

       Calf liver

Cut into ⅓ inch slices. Season the slices with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Dredge them with:

       Flour (optional)

Sauté them until done[1] (a matter of 2 or 3 minutes) in:

       Hot bacon drippings or melted butter

Serve them with:

       Crisp bacon

If you wish to serve onions with sautéed liver, sauté them, keep them
hot, cook liver as directed on one side, turn it, heap the onions on the
cooked side and continue to cook the liver until done. If you wish to
serve bacon, sauté it first and keep it hot.

-----

[1] The pan may be rubbed with a cut clove of garlic or you may flavor
the liver when cooked with grated lemon rind and juice.

Some epicures have a preference for liver prepared in the following way;
doctors have, too. I lean toward the sautéed liver above, but must
acknowledge the good qualities of this rule, which calls for liver pure
and simple.

Place on a broiling rack about 3 inches from a good flame:

       Slices of liver ⅓ inch thick

Leave the door of the broiling oven open. Broil the liver exactly one
minute on each side. Season it, if you wish. It is remarkably good as it
is. Or dip the slices in:

       Melted butter
       Lemon juice (4 tablespoons butter to 1 tablespoon lemon juice)

Broil them under a broiler (about 1½ minutes to a side). Season them
lightly with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Broil previously:

       Slices of bacon
       Bermuda onions

Serve the liver, bacon and onions on a hot platter garnished with:

       Parsley
       A lemon cut into quarters

                 *        *        *        *        *

                   LIVER LUNCHEON or BREAKFAST SPREAD

My unknown friend (the Maryland man who contributed the delicious recipe
for Oysters Baked in the Half Shell, page 114), is responsible for the
following equally good and unusual dish. I am giving it in his own
words.

Soak (marinate) calf’s liver ½ hour or more (perhaps overnight) in a
{pg 346}mixture of milk and red wine. (The liver is, of course, already
prepared à la Rombauer, page 344).

Sauté in butter until nearly done, but when less than halfway done add
to the skillet thinly sliced mushrooms to about equal the weight of the
liver. Add more butter if necessary. Be sure that both liver and
mushrooms are cooked to the point of tenderness, but not beyond. Cut the
liver in strips for the chopper and put it and the mushrooms through a
very fine chopper, alternately, so that they mix.

Add the milk and wine in which the liver was soaked to the remaining
butter, etc., in the skillet and heat. (Economical, what?) Thoroughly
moisten the chopped mixture with this, adding more wine only if
necessary for more moisture. Add salt, pepper, onion salt and
Worcestershire sauce. Also paprika. Also lemon juice. All these
seasonings in moderate quantities. Stir thoroughly and finish cooking in
a double boiler or chafing dish over boiling water, stirring again from
time to time.

Serve on toast, French bread, if available, or for canapés, crackers. It
is not bad even when cold, but for breakfast or lunch, the hotter the
plates, toast and mixture the better.

                     LIVER DUMPLINGS (LEBERKLOESSE)

6 Servings

Being the child of a South German. I cannot well compile a cookbook
without including a dish that is typical of that neck of the woods—not
exactly a handsome one, but it has qualities. Besides, liver is now “de
rigueur.”

Skin and remove the fiber from:

     1 pound calf liver or chicken livers

Grind or chop it until it is very fine. Soak in water for 3 minutes,
then wring the water from:

     2 slices white bread (1 cup)

Beat:

     2 egg yolks
     ¼ cup soft butter

Add and combine with the liver and the bread:

     2 teaspoons chopped onion
     2 tablespoons chopped parsley
    1½ teaspoons salt
     ½ teaspoon pepper
     2 tablespoons flour

Beat until stiff:

     2 egg whites

Fold them into the other ingredients. Shape this mixture into 1½ inch
balls. Drop them into gently boiling:

       Soup Stock (page 50)

Cook them for 5 or 6 minutes. Serve them with the soup. Or, drop them
into boiling water, drain them and serve them with:

       Sautéed Onions (page 283)

A good “follow-up dish” is liver dumplings sliced and sautéed in onion
butter.

     1 slice bacon chopped
     ½ cup dry bread crumbs
     ¼ cup evaporated milk or cream
     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon pepper

Shape these ingredients into 6 cakes. Wrap around the cakes:

     6 slices Of bacon

Secure the bacon with toothpicks. Place the cakes in a lightly greased
pan in a hot oven 425°. Cook them until they are well browned. Turn them
to insure even baking.

     2 medium-sized onions
     1 large carrot
     3 or more ribs of celery with leaves

Wash and add:

     6 sprigs of parsley

Barely cover these ingredients with boiling water. Add: {pg 347}

     8 peppercorns
     1 teaspoon salt

Simmer the tongue until it is tender (for about 3 hours). Drain it.
Reserve the liquor. Skin the tongue. Remove the roots. Place the tongue
where it will keep hot. Serve it with:

Cover the tongue with fresh water. Add:

     1 onion, sliced
     ½ cup chopped celery with leaves
     3 bay leaves
     1 teaspoon peppercorns

Simmer it until it is tender (from 2 to 4 hours). Leave it in the stock
until it is slightly cooled. When cold enough to handle, skin it and
remove all the dry, hard portions and the roots. It is then ready to be
sliced and served. The tongue may be served hot with:

       Creamed Spinach (page 266)
       Horseradish Sauce (page 380)

                               CALF HEAD

This recipe in an old family cookbook reads: “Calf’s head with tongue
and brain, 25 cents.” That notation belongs to the past, so does the
manner in which the recipe is written, but the dish remains a standard
and a great favorite with gourmets.

Remove the brain from:

       A calf head

Boil:

     2 quarts water
     1 carrot
     1 onion
     ½ lemon sliced
     1 bay leaf
     4 cloves
     1 tablespoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon pepper

Add the head and tongue—the last is {pg 349}optional. Simmer it covered
until the meat is tender—for about 2 hours. If the tongue is used, it
will take longer. Add the brains for the last 15 minutes of cooking.
Dice them. Cut the meat from the cheeks into small pieces. Skin, remove
the roots, then slice the tongue.

Prepare a sauce with:

     4 tablespoons butter[1]
     4 tablespoons flour
     2 cups liquid, in which the meat was cooked

Reheat the meat in the sauce. Season it if needed. It is sometimes made
rather acid with lemon, vinegar or wine. Serve it with:

       Chopped parsley

This dish is sometimes served with the addition at the last moment of:

     ½ cup scalded cream[2]

Or part of the sauce is drained off. Beat into it:

     2 egg yolks

Return the sauce to the pot. Heat but do not boil the sauce after adding
the yolks.

-----

[1] If the tongue is used, treble this recipe.

[2] If you add cream or egg yolks do not add lemon, vinegar or wine
until the last moment.

                              HEAD CHEESE

A well-liked old-fashioned dish.

Quarter:

       A calf head

Remove ears, brains, eyes, snout and most of the fat. Soak the quarters
in cold water to extract the blood. Wash them. Cover with cold water.
Simmer until the meat is ready to fall from the bones. Drain. Separate
the meat from the bones. Dice it, cover it well with the stock. Add
salt, pepper and herbs. Cook for ½ hour. Pour into a mold, cover with a
cloth. Put a weight on top. Chill. Serve cut into slices.


                                 Tripe

Tripe is the inner muscular lining of the stomach of meat animals.
Honeycomb, the most delicate tripe, is the lining of the stomach of
beef. Any may be used in the following recipes.

Simmering in water is a preliminary to all ways of serving tripe. Tripe
is sometimes cooked before it is sold. It may also be bought pickled or
canned. Pickled tripe requires a shorter period of cooking. Fresh tripe
whole, calls for four hours or more of simmering; if it is cut into
strips you may allow two hours or more.

3 Servings

Wash several times:

     1 pound honeycomb tripe

Cut it into strips[1], cover them with cold water. Bring the water to
the boiling point. Add:

     ¼ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon sugar

Cover the pot. Simmer the tripe for 2 hours. Add:

     1 clove garlic, sliced
     ⅓ cup chopped onion
     1 cup chopped celery and parsley
     4 peppercorns

Simmer the tripe until it is tender (for about 1 hour longer). Watch it,
as it burns easily. Thicken the stock with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

Season the gravy with:

       Salt
     ½ teaspoon prepared mustard
     1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Tripe may be served with Cream Sauce (use part stock and part cream),
Onion Sauce, etc. You may flavor it with Worcestershire sauce or
mustard.

                            Poultry and Game


Poultry is usually plucked and drawn when purchased. If if is not
{pg 351}pick the feathers from a bird. Remove all pin feathers—use a
pair of tweezers or grasp them between forefinger and the tip of a
knife, then pull.

To draw the bird, make an incision through the skin below the breast
bone large enough to admit the hand. Draw out all entrails, giblets,
etc. Cut off the head. Draw down the neck skin. Cut the neck close to
the body. Leave a generous flap of skin. Remove the crop and wind pipe
by making an incision at the base of the neck and drawing them out. Cut
out the oil sac at the base of the tail. Hold the bird by the legs and
singe the hair or down over a gas flame, candle, etc. Turn it so that
all parts of the skin are exposed to the heat. Now cut off the feet.
Most butchers use a clever gadget that breaks the foot, holds it
securely and draws the tendons at the same time that the foot separates
from the body. Amateurs have a somewhat harder time. In large birds the
tendons are apt to be tough and are therefore removed. Cut the legs
around just below the knee joint. Be careful not to cut the tendons. Lay
the cut at the end of the table. Press down sharply to break the bone,
then pull. The tendons should come away with the foot and lower leg.
After cracking the bone the tendons may be drawn out with a skewer.
Removing tendons sounds complicated and troublesome, but all authorities
recommend it.

Scrub the chicken inside and out[1] with warm water to which you may add
1 tablespoonful of soda. (Do not soak the chicken in water at any time).
Hold it under running water to clean the inside. Insert the fingers in
the cavities to remove the last bits of viscera. Dry the bird well with
a cloth. Season the inside with salt—about ⅓ teaspoonful to the pound.
Stuff the chicken loosely with dressing. Fill it about three-fourths
full, as the dressing will expand. Your task will be easier if you place
the bird in a large bowl. The crop cavity may be stuffed too. You may
loosen the breast skin with a spoon and fill out the breast with
dressing. Close the openings with small skewers and a crisscrossed
string or sew them with the old-fashioned needle and thread. Truss the
chicken. You may leave long ends of string hanging from the skewers or
you may tie a piece of string around the skin of the neck. Leave two
long ends. Turn the wings back and pass the string around them.
{pg 352}Tie the legs so that they will be close to the body. Tie the
ends of the drumsticks together.

-----

[1] A new school advances a new method. Dispense with washing the
outside of the bird. Rub it well with a cut lemon.


                                Giblets

These are the heart, gizzard and liver. Remove the thin veins and blood
around the heart. Discard them. Cut the fat and membrane from the
gizzard. Make a long gash along the thick edge down to the gray lining.
Don’t cut into the stomach sac if you can help it. Pull out the sac,
discard it. Separate the gall bladder from the liver (don’t break it).
Cut away the discolored parts of the liver, if any. Wash the giblets.
You will find a good way of using them on page 353. They are frequently
served in gravy or creamed with omelet, vegetables, rice, etc. (See
Chicken Liver Paste, page 38; Chicken Liver Timbales, page 214; Chicken
Livers, Green Peas and Carrots, page 141; Chicken Livers Sautéed with
Onions, page 141.)


        Time and Temperature Chart for Roasting Poultry and Game

The old method of roasting poultry and game has been discarded by
moderns. It called for a hot oven at first, then a reduced heat and much
basting. The new method teaches us that a constant low temperature
results in less shrinkage and juicier and more tender meat.

To figure the time for roasting fowl or game, weigh the fowl before it
is drawn or after it is stuffed. Multiply the weight of the fowl by the
minutes per pound given in the following chart. Use the lower figure for
large birds, the higher figure for small birds. The meat should be at
room temperature. If chilled add 15 to 30 minutes to the total cooking
time.

                             ROAST CHICKEN

6 Servings

A 4 to 5 pound chicken requires {pg 353}from 30 to 35 minutes’ baking
per pound. A small chicken requires from 30 to 45 minutes per pound. The
fowl should be weighed before it is drawn or after it is stuffed. Have
the fowl at room temperature (which will give you the most satisfactory
results). If the fowl is chilled add 15 to 20 minutes to the cooking
time. Season the inside of the chicken with salt—use about ⅓
teaspoonful to the pound. You may rub the outside of a fowl with a cut
lemon in preference to washing it. Stuff loosely (the filling will grow
in bulk):

       A 4 pound chicken

with:

       Boiled Rice (page 100)
       Potato, Oyster or Bread Dressing (page 369)

Stuff the body cavity and the crop cavity. Sew them together with a
needle and thread or use skewers and a piece of string to crisscross
them together. Truss the chicken (see the preceding rule) and place it,
uncovered, in a roasting pan. Place over the breast a piece of body fat
from the chicken, then a clean cloth or cover it with a cloth dipped
into melted unsalted fat. Roast it uncovered in a slow oven 300° until
tender, basting occasionally with drippings unless using the layer of
body fat, which serves to baste the bird as it melts. Season the chicken
with salt when half done. Remove the cloth for the last half-hour of the
roasting period to finish browning. Serve the chicken with:

       Gravy (see this page)

While the chicken is roasting, prepare:

                 *        *        *        *        *

                             CHICKEN STOCK

Combine and boil:

     3 cups water (2 cups for a small chicken)
     2 ribs celery with leaves
     1 sliced carrot
     ½ sliced onion
     3 sprigs parsley

Add:

       The chicken giblets
       Neck
       Wing tips

Simmer these ingredients until the liver is tender. Remove the liver.
Simmer the remaining ingredients until the gizzard is tender. Remove the
meat and strain the stock. Prepare:

Strain the drippings from the roast chicken. Pour off the fat. Heat:

     4 tablespoons fat

Add and stir until blended:

     4 tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

     2 cups pan drippings and stock

Cook and stir the gravy until it is smooth and boiling. Add:

     ¼ cup or more cream (optional but very good)
       The chopped chicken giblets

Add if required:

       Salt
       Paprika

If the gravy is very rich it may separate. Add the cream slowly, stir it
constantly. This usually will remedy it.

[1] A quick and efficient way to flour food is to place it in a paper
bag with seasoned flour, close the bag and shake it vigorously. The food
will be evenly coated. Some prefer chicken coated with corn meal. A
heavy coating is apt to be tough.

[2] The amount of fat to be used always raises a domestic discussion. My
cook, Sarah Brown, likes about ½ inch of fat in the skillet—part butter
and part lard. She claims that the lard gives the chicken a better
color. I like just enough fat to cover the bottom of the skillet and
prefer to have it all butter (but I must admit that Sarah’s chicken is
mighty good). Lard seems to make a coarse gravy. Use two skillets if
several chickens are to be fried.

                     CHICKEN in BATTER—FRENCH FRIED

A 3 pound chicken serves 4 persons

Clean and cut into pieces:

       Young roasting chickens

Drop the pieces slowly one by one into:

       Boiling salted water to cover[1]

Do not disturb the boiling point. Add to the water for flavor:

       Vegetables (onion, carrot, parsley, celery)

Simmer the chickens until they are tender. Cool them thoroughly. Dry
them between towels. Prepare the following batter:

Sift:

     2 cups flour
     3 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 2 teaspoons
       combination type baking powder[2]
     ½ teaspoon salt

Beat:

     2 eggs
    1½ cups milk

Stir the liquid into the dry ingredients. Dip each piece of chicken in
the batter. Drop it into deep fat heated to 375° (see page 477). Fry the
chicken until the pieces are a golden brown. Serve it with gravy (page
377) made with the chicken stock and cream.

     ½ cup chopped onions
     1 (2 lb. 3 oz.) can Italian peeled tomatoes
     ½ cup dry white wine
     1 teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon pepper
     ½ bay leaf
     ⅛ teaspoon thyme

                             STEWED CHICKEN

A 5 pound stewing chicken serves 5 to 6 people

The following is the best way to prepare a large chicken of doubtful
age.

Clean and cut into pieces:

       A stewing chicken

Place in a stewing pan and bring to the boiling point:

     3 cups water
     1 sliced carrot
     1 small sliced onion
     2 ribs of celery with leaves

Drop the chicken piece by piece into the boiling liquid. Do this slowly
so as not to disturb the boiling point. As the liquid will increase in
volume, the chicken need only be covered to the depth of ½ inch. Cover
the pot closely and simmer the chicken until it is tender (2 hours or
more), but do not boil it at any time. At the end of the first hour of
cooking add:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika or 3 or 4 peppercorns

Remove the chicken from the pot.

First Method:

Strain the stock. Thicken it with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

If a very concentrated gravy is desired, boil the stock before
thickening it until it is reduced to 1½ cupfuls. If the gravy threatens
to separate, stir into it slowly:

     2 or more tablespoons cream

Return the chicken to the boiling gravy. Serve it as directed in the
second method.

Second Method:

A richer gravy is made in the following way.

Melt:

    1½ tablespoons chicken fat

Stir in until blended:

     ¾ tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

     2 cups chicken stock

Stir and cook these ingredients for 2 minutes.

Beat well:

     2 egg yolks
     2 tablespoons cream

Reduce the heat to a low flame. Stir the yolk mixture gradually into the
gravy. Permit the yolks to thicken slightly. Add if needed:

       Salt
       Paprika

Pour the gravy over the chicken. Garnish it with:

       Parsley

Serve it with:

       Noodles (page 98), Dumplings (page 375), Boiled Rice (page 100) or
       Baked Macaroni (page 96)

                       STEWED CHICKEN and ONIONS

4 Servings

This recipe calls for a young hen.

Follow the preceding rule for:

       Stewed Chicken

Peel:

    24 small white onions

After the chicken has simmered for 1 hour add the seasoning as directed
and drop in the onions slowly so as not to disturb the boiling point.
Cook the stew until the chicken and the onions are tender. Remove the
chicken to a hot platter. Arrange the onions around it. Keep it hot.
Prepare the gravy by the Second Method. Add to it:

     1 teaspoon lemon juice
     2 tablespoons chopped parsley

Pour the gravy over the chicken.

                 *        *        *        *        *

2 to 3 Servings

Clean:

       A guinea hen (see page 351)

Lard it[1] with:

       Salt pork

Fill it with:

       Onion, Bread or other Dressing (page 369)

Close the opening. Truss the bird. {pg 360}Place it in a pan breast
down. Roast it uncovered in a moderate oven 350° for 1 hour. Roast it
breast side up for 1 hour longer or until tender. Baste it every half
hour. Thicken the drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

                         BREASTS OF GUINEA HEN

Allow 1 breast per person

Since I have become known as a consultant on culinary matters, endless
strangers call up, sometimes for advice but usually for confirmation of
what they planned to do in the first place. I am also called on in
moments of stress. A frenzied voice came over the telephone one day
saying: “I use your cook book, I _do_. She’s gone out. She’s left me
with breast of guinea hen. My God! What do I do?”

Lard:

       Breasts of guinea hen

with:

     4 lardoons[1] of salt pork each

Follow the rule for Breasts of Chicken (page 357).

After 10 minutes’ baking in a hot oven 425°, reduce the heat to a
moderate oven 325°. Baste the fillets frequently. Cook them for about 1
hour or until they are tender. To serve them follow the rule for Breasts
of Chicken (page 357).

                              ROAST TURKEY

Allow ¾ to 1 pound of turkey per person

Draw (see page 351):

       A turkey

Remove the windpipe and crop from the neck opening. Cut off the neck
close to the body but leave the neck skin. Scrub the turkey inside and
out with warm water to which you may add 1 tablespoonful of baking soda.
Dry the turkey with a cloth. Rub it well on the inside with salt. Fill
the body cavity loosely—it will increase in bulk—with:

       Chestnut, Bread or other Dressing (page 369)

Sew up the incision or secure it with skewers. Wrap a string crisscross
fashion about them. Fill the neck cavity.[1] Sew it up or use skewers to
close it. Tie back the flap of neck skin. Truss the bird so that the
wings are bent behind the back and the legs are close to the body. Tie
the leg bones together. Place the bird, breast up, in a roasting pan.
Brush the breast, legs and wings with:

       Unsalted, melted fat

Dip a cloth in the fat and place it over the bird, or place a thick
layer of body fat on the bird and cover it with a piece of waxed paper
or a cloth. Roast the turkey, uncovered, in a slow oven 300° until
tender. Allow 25 minutes per pound for a bird under 12 pounds, or 20
minutes per pound for a larger bird. Baste the turkey every half hour
with the pan drippings. Season it with salt and paprika when it is half
cooked. Remove the paper or cloth for the last half hour of cooking. To
prepare the gravy see:

       Chicken Stock and Chicken Gravy (page 353)

Double or treble the amounts according to the size of the turkey. The
turkey liver may be placed in the pan for the last hour of cooking, or
you may cook the giblets by the rule for Chicken Giblets (see Chicken
Stock, page 353) allowing a somewhat longer time for cooking.

                              ROAST GOOSE

8 Servings

Prepare for cooking (page 351):

       An 8 pound goose

Season the inside with:

       Salt

Fill the cavities with:

       Apple, Prune, Chestnut or other Dressing (page 369)

Prick through the skin into the fat layer around the legs and wings.
Truss the goose. Roast it on a rack in an uncovered pan in a moderate
oven 325° allowing 25 minutes to the pound. You may place in the pan a
cut clove of garlic or onion and several stalks of celery with leaves.
Baste the goose at 15 minute intervals with the pan drippings. When the
goose is half done season it with: {pg 361}

       Salt
       Pepper
     ½ teaspoon ginger

Thicken the drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377, or see Chicken Stock and Gravy, page
       353)

Goose liver is considered a great delicacy. Remove the gall bladder.
Soak the liver in cold salted water for 2 hours. Dry it with a cloth.

I. Sprinkle it with:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika
     ½ teaspoon sugar
     ⅛ teaspoon ginger

Sauté it in hot goose fat until it is tender.

II. Prepare and soak the liver as directed. Place it in an oven-proof
dish. Cover it with:

     1 cup brown sugar
     ¼ teaspoon salt
     1 cup sherry

Place it under a low flame for ½ hour. Watch it so that it does not
burn. Baste it frequently to prevent a crust from forming. Cook sliced
apples in a thick sirup until well glazed. Place them around the liver.
Continue to baste with apple sirup until the liver is tender.

                          ROAST DUCK BIGARADE

4 Servings

Prepare for cooking (see preceding rule):

       A 3½ to 4 pound duck

Place it unstuffed on a rack in a pan in a moderate oven 325°. Roast the
duck uncovered, allowing 20 to 30 minutes to the pound. Skin:

       An orange

Scrape the white pulp from the skin with a spoon and discard. Cut the
yellow peel into very thin strips (julienne). Add a cup of boiling water
and simmer the peel for 15 minutes. Drain it. Remove all membrane from
the orange sections, discard it. Reserve the juice. Fifteen minutes
before the duck is done pour the drippings from the pan. Replace them
by:

     ½ cup boiling consommé

Continue to cook the duck. Add to the drippings the orange juice and:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     1 teaspoon sugar
     ½ teaspoon lemon juice

Simmer these ingredients for 10 minutes. Add and stir until dissolved:

     2 tablespoons currant jelly

Add the orange peel and simmer 10 minutes longer. Add the consommé from
the pan and:

    1½ tablespoons Madeira wine

Sprinkle the orange sections with:

     3 teaspoons sugar

Broil them for 3 minutes. Cut the duck into individual servings. Arrange
it on a hot platter. Garnish it with the orange sections and dabs of:

       Currant jelly

Pour the sauce over it. Duck sauce is also flavored with kuemmel,
curaçao or white wine and a more generous amount of orange juice.

                 Wild Duck, Partridge, Pheasant, Grouse

A good story is told about a professor, weighted with many degrees, with
an ambition to drive an automobile. After many attempts, the youth who
was trying to teach him, maddened by his inability to do so (and a
narrow escape from death), shouted: “My God, man, the trouble with you
is you gotta learn to use your mind!”

These instructions are as clear as I can make them, but they are not
infallible. (How can they be when one authority says: “Never destroy the
flavor of wild duck by washing it”; and another says: “Always soak a
wild duck in water for two hours”?)

Since you may be burdened by tradition amounting in some instances to
misinformation, and will in addition read and hear many things that are
confusing, approach the matter of cooking with an open mind. Draw your
conclusions from your experiences and be guided by your tastes and
impulses. This book is supposed to be a beacon (I devoutly hope it is!)
to light your way. Your path is your own and a healthy curiosity should
lead you into many agreeable byways, provided you use your mind.

                           To Clean Wild Duck

Clip the wing tips and remove the coarse guard feathers, leaving the
duck covered with down. Melt a cake of paraffin and paint the duck,
using a brush and covering the entire surface of the bird with hot wax.
Allow the paraffin to harden and pull it off. It will carry the feathers
with it. Ducks shot in the spring are frequently strong flavored. Soak
the cleaned bird 2 or 3 hours in fairly strong salt water to which 1
tablespoonful baking soda has been added. Rinse, dry, then stuff with
sliced apple or celery. Remove the stuffing before serving the duck; it
will have absorbed the strong flavor.

                            ROAST DUCK—WILD

4 to 6 Servings

Wipe with a damp cloth:

     2 (2½ pound) wild ducks

If they are not fresh add ½ teaspoon soda to a quart of water and rinse
them well. Dry thoroughly inside and out. Rub the insides with:

       Salt

Fill the cavities loosely with:

       Skinned onions, drained sauerkraut or peeled, cored and chopped
       apples (raisins may be added) or Sweet Potatoes and Apples (page
       372)

Place the ducks in an uncovered roasting pan. Cover the breasts with:

       Thin slices of salt pork or bacon

or brush them with:

       Butter

Roast the ducks in a moderate oven 325°: rare duck, 10 to 12 minutes to
the pound; well done, 15 to 20 minutes to the pound.

When the ducks are half done, season them with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Baste them frequently with the fat in the pan. Another school of thought
advises roasting duck in a hot oven 500° for 18 to 20 minutes (total
time). Baste them every 5 minutes with the fat in the pan. This seems to
be the hunter’s ideal. The juices are red and flow freely when the duck
is carved. Thicken the drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

Add:

       Sour cream (optional)

Serve the duck with:

       Currant jelly or cranberries

or with overlapping:

       Slices of small oranges, each topped with a dab of bright jelly

A good way to cook wild duck and an easy way of serving it is to split
it {pg 363}down the back, clean it well and wipe it until it is dry. Rub
it with:

       Garlic (optional)

Spread it with:

       Butter

Season it with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Place it in a pan in a hot oven 450°. Baste it frequently with the fat
in the pan. Cook it until it has reached the right degree of doneness.
Remove it to a hot platter. Thicken the drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

Serve the duck with:

       Boiled Oranges or Kumquats (pages 399, 400)

An unusual way to cook duck is to fill it with:

       Skinned onions
       A quartered orange

(about 3 medium-sized onions and ¼ orange to each duck).

Follow the rule for cooking Wild Duck. Place in the bottom of the pan:

     ¼ cup Kiefer berries
     1 cup grape juice or orange juice

Fried hominy is a well-known accompaniment to duck—so are grilled sweet
potatoes or apples stuffed with sweet potatoes.

                           BRAISED WILD DUCK

Dress:

       Wild duck (preferably mallards)

Stuff them with:

       Apple, Celery, Apricot or Bread Dressing, etc. (page 369)

Place them in a roaster. Add boiling water to the depth of ½ inch. Add:

     ½ onion, sliced
     3 stalks celery with leaves
     ½ teaspoon dry thyme

Cover the roaster. Cook the duck in a slow oven 325° for about 1 hour.
Add water as needed. Remove the cover. Cook the duck for ½ hour longer.
Thicken the drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

You may add to the gravy:

     1 tablespoon orange marmalade

or you may serve the duck sprinkled with:

       A grating of orange rind

and garnished with:

       Currant jelly

or with:

       Orange Salad for Game (page 410)

     2 large wild ducks

Broil them under a flame until they are brown. Baste them frequently
with the following sauce. Combine and stir over heat:

     4 teaspoons lemon juice
     1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
     1 teaspoon tomato catsup
     1 tablespoon butter

Sprinkle the duck after it has begun to brown with:

       Salt
       Paprika

                 *        *        *        *        *

                               DUCK PILAU

A left-over duck and rice dish.

Remove the meat from:

       Roast duck

There should be about 2 cupfuls.

Break the carcasses apart. Add to them:

     4 cups water
     1 chopped onion
       Some celery leaves

Simmer this stock for 1 hour. Strain it. Bring it to the boiling point.
Stir into it slowly so as not to disturb the boiling:

     ⅔ cup rice

Cook the rice until it is tender (for about ½ hour). Strain it. Reserve
the liquor. Rinse the rice in cold water.[1] Drain it. Melt:

     2 tablespoons butter

Add and sauté covered for 5 minutes:

     ¾ cup finely chopped celery
     1 teaspoon grated onion

Add the duck scraps, the rice and:

     1 cup left-over gravy, duck liquor or cream combined

Mix these ingredients well with a fork. Season them, if needed, with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Serve the pilau hot with:

       Stewed plums or apricots

                            ROAST PARTRIDGE

These birds may be sautéed, smothered or stewed by any rule for chicken.
As they are somewhat drier {pg 364}a little additional fat helps them
along. They are frequently larded.

Rub the inside of a drawn and cleaned:

       Partridge

with:

       Salt
       Butter

Place over the breast:

       Slices of fat bacon

Truss the bird. Roast it like chicken in a moderate oven 350°, 30 to 35
minutes in all. The bacon is removed for the last 15 minutes of cooking.
It is customary to serve the bird with the unthickened pan drippings, to
which lemon juice, sherry or port may be added.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                             ROAST PHEASANT

Allow 1 bird for 3 or 4 persons

Follow the above rule for:

       Roast Partridge

Allow 15 to 20 minutes to the pound.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                       GROUSE or PRAIRIE CHICKEN

Allow 1 bird for 3 or 4 persons

Follow any rule for chicken. Roast the bird at 350° and allow 1 to 1¼
hours total time. If sautéed allow about 45 minutes.

                           QUAIL, SNIPE, ETC.

Volumes have been written by epicures on the manner of cooking small
birds. Of course, the opinions are diverse but a consensus seems to be
that small birds may be broiled or roasted, but larger ones must be
roasted.

                      QUAIL, SNIPE, etc., BROILED

Pick, draw and clean[1] (the French do not draw):

     6 small birds

       Salt
       Pepper

Rub them with:

     2 tablespoons butter

Surround them with:

     6 strips of bacon

Truss them with string. Place them on a broiler under a low flame. Cook
them from 12 to 20 minutes, according to their size. Turn them
frequently. The bacon may be removed, if desired. Thicken the drippings
with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

Add the juice of:

     1 lemon (optional)

                       Rabbit, Hare and Squirrel

The preparation and cooking of these animals is much the same, although
the size varies greatly.

Clean and cut into pieces:

       A rabbit

Place them in a crock or jar. Cover them with:

       Vinegar and water, in equal parts

Add:

     1 onion sliced

     6 peppercorns
     1 bay leaf

Soak the rabbit for 2 days, then remove the meat, keeping the liquor.
Follow the rule for Rabbit Stew (page 366). Use the vinegar water in the
place of stock and add sour or sweet cream to the gravy (see Gravy, page
377).

                          ROAST RABBIT or HARE

A rabbit is usually too small to stuff. A hare may be stuffed with any
dressing suitable for fowl.

Season a rabbit or hare inside with salt, stuff it, close the opening
and truss it. Brush it all over with:

       Melted butter, drippings or olive oil

Dredge it with:

       Seasoned flour

Place it on its side in a roasting pan. Roast it uncovered in a moderate
oven 325° for 1½ to 2 hours. Baste it every 15 minutes with the
drippings in the pan. If it becomes dry baste with half butter and half
water or stock. Turn the rabbit when half cooked. Thicken the drippings
with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)


                                Venison

Hang venison in a cool airy place. Some authorities say “from 4 to 5
days”; others say “for two weeks or more.” This is a matter of taste. In
Europe game is hung until it is so ripe that a guest is aware of the
type of dinner to be served him as soon as he enters the front door.

Venison may be prepared in as many ways as beef and much in the same
manner. However, today this meat is an unusual treat and the addition of
wine, mushrooms, cream, etc., seems in order to make a super dish of a
super meat. There is a consensus that venison must be served rare.

Port, Madeira and claret are frequently added to the gravy served with
venison. {pg 368}

                           SADDLE of VENISON

8 Servings

Lard by the rule on page 818:

       A 6 to 7 pound saddle of venison

Rub it with:

       A cut clove of garlic (optional)
       Butter

Sprinkle it with:

    2½ teaspoons salt
     ¼ teaspoon pepper or ½ teaspoon paprika
       A few grains of cayenne

Place the roast, uncovered, in a moderate oven 325°. Allow 25 to 30
minutes to the pound.

Or you may place the roast in a hot oven 450° for ½ hour, then reduce
the heat and continue to cook it at 300°, allowing in all 20 minutes to
the pound. Thicken the drippings with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

You may add:

       Consommé or Chicken Stock or Stock Substitute (page 52) and sour or
       sweet cream

Garnish the platter with:

       Orange slices, currant jelly, Orange Sauce for Game (page 387) or
       Cumberland Sauce (page 388)

Serve venison with:

       Wild Rice (page 101)

                 *        *        *        *        *

                          ROAST LEG of VENISON

Follow the above rule for Saddle of Venison. Roast a leg skin side down.
If the venison is very dry place several pieces of bacon over the top.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                             VENISON STEAKS

See that these are crisp and brown on the outside, rare and juicy
within. This means a quick hot fire. Rub:

       Venison steaks

with:

       A cut clove of garlic
       A generous amount of butter

Season with:

       Salt
       Paprika or pepper

Broil the steaks under a broiler or over a hot open fire. Make this a
short process unless the steaks are very thick. Serve them with:

       Currant Jelly Sauce (page 386)

or with:

       Maître d’hôtel Butter (page 390)

                     VENISON LOIN STEAKS or CUTLETS

These may be dipped in:

       Olive oil

then in:

       Seasoned bread crumbs

Broil the steaks or sauté them quickly in butter. Or rub:

     2 venison steaks

with:

       A cut clove of garlic

Heat until sizzling:

     1 tablespoon olive oil

Sauté the steaks quickly in this until both sides are brown. Season the
steaks with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Stir in:

     ¼ cup dry sherry
     ⅓ cup thick cream
    1½ tablespoons currant jelly
     2 tablespoons butter

Add additional seasoning if required.

                       VENISON POT ROAST or STEW

For this use the less tender cuts of meat cut into small pieces or one
large piece. You may do this by placing the meat in a marinade, or this
step may be omitted and the meat may be prepared like Pot Roast (page
309).

Marinade for Venison:

Cover venison with:

       Equal parts of water and wine, preferably claret

Add:

    1½ teaspoons salt
     6 or 8 black peppercorns
     1 bay leaf
    10 to 12 whole cloves
     1 onion, sliced

Permit the meat to remain in the marinade from 2 to 6 days. Turn it from
time to time. Dry the meat, dredge it lightly with:

       Flour

Follow the rule on page 309 for Pot Roast. Use the marinade in place of
other liquid. Simmer the meat covered until tender. The time will vary
with the age of the animal.

You may skim the fat from the drippings. Add to them:

     1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
     3 tablespoons lemon juice
     ⅓ cup port wine
    1½ tablespoons butter
       Seasoning, if needed

Reheat the drippings. Place the meat in them. {pg 369}

                       Dressings for Meat or Fowl

These are an important part of the menu, especially on holidays. Vary
them according to your means and your imagination. Stuff a bird lightly.
The dressing will swell as it cooks. An abundance of liquid will make a
dressing soggy. Allow a generous cupful of dressing for every pound of
bird. As it is better to have too much rather than too little of it,
place the surplus in a greased dish. Bake it in the oven with the bird
for the last hour of cooking.

      BREAD DRESSING with MUSHROOMS, OYSTERS, NUTS, GIBLETS, etc.

About 4 cupfuls

Sufficient for a 4 pound chicken. Allow about 1 cupful of dressing to 1
pound of dressed bird

There is no set rule for the proportions of ingredients for bread
dressing. It should be palatable, light and slightly moist, well
flavored but bland. Chopped green peppers, nut meats, sautéed mushrooms
and drained or lightly sautéed oysters may be added to it. Stock or
oyster liquor may be substituted for milk.

Chop the giblets. Melt:

     ¼ cup butter

Add and sauté for 2 minutes:

     2 tablespoons or more chopped onion and the chopped giblets
       (optional)

Combine these ingredients with: {pg 370}

     4 cups crustless, diced bread (white, graham or whole wheat)[1] or
       bread crumbs (corn-bread crumbs may be used)
     2 or 3 eggs (optional)
     4 tablespoons chopped parsley
     ¼ to 1 cup chopped celery
     ¾ teaspoon salt
     ½ teaspoon paprika
     ⅛ teaspoon nutmeg
    1½ cups nut meats, preferably black walnuts (optional)
       Milk, stock or melted butter to moisten the dressing very lightly

In place of the nut meats you may use:

     6 pork sausages, skinned, sliced and browned, or
     1 cup or more sliced mushrooms sautéed with the onion

-----

[1] Preferably one day old. Bread two days old may be toasted for a
light dressing.

Follow the preceding rule. Omit the giblets and the nut meats. Add:

     ½ to 1 pint oysters, drained

Chop them or leave them whole. They may be preheated in the hot butter.
Use part milk and part oyster liquor.

inch thick. Place over the top:

       Mushrooms, whole or sliced

Dot them well with:

       Butter

Sprinkle them with:

       Cream

Bake the dressing in a hot oven 400° for about 15 minutes.

                             “DRY” DRESSING

This name is given by my cook, Sarah Brown, to a dressing she frequently
makes, which is by no means dry when served. Combine:

       Shredded bread (white, graham or whole wheat)
       Chopped celery
       Chopped onion

Season the inside of a chicken, quail, turkey, etc., with:

       Salt
       Paprika

Partly fill it with the dressing. Melt:

       Butter

Pour it onto the dressing. Fill the cavity lightly with the remaining
dressing. Melt:

       Butter

Pour it onto the dressing. Sew up the opening. Proportions seem to be of
no importance whatever in this case as the ingredients are never
measured and the dressing is always light and good. Chopped pecans,
oysters, olives, etc., may be added to it.

     2 cups boiling water
     ½ bay leaf (optional)
       Some celery ribs and leaves
       Salt

Cook them until they are very tender. Chop the giblets very fine and add
them later to the turkey gravy. (Use the stock for the gravy.) Crush or
grind enough toasted bread to make:

     6 cups dry bread crumbs (corn, graham, whole wheat or white)

Add and mix thoroughly:

     1 teaspoon salt

     ¾ pound sausage meat
    1½ cups chopped celery

Moisten these ingredients lightly with the:

       Giblet stock

The dressing should be crumbly—not very moist.

               Dumplings, Spoon Bread, Yorkshire Pudding
                           RULE FOR DUMPLINGS

Dumplings are apt to be heavy if the lid is lifted frequently before
they are done. In order to see how the dumplings are progressing while
cooking, cover the pan with a glass pie plate. This will tell you what
you want to know without curbing their desire for Lebensraum.

                               DUMPLINGS

4 Servings

These dumplings are worth a trial as the experiment is apt to be
repeated.

Measure, then sift 3 times:

     1 cup cake flour
     4 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 2 teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)
     ½ teaspoon salt

Break into a measuring cup:

     1 egg

Add until the cup is half full:

       Milk

Beat well and stir the liquid slowly into the sifted ingredients. Add
more milk if necessary but keep the batter as stiff as possible.
Thicken:

     2 or 3 cups Stock (page 50) or Stock Substitute (page 52)

with:

       Flour (allow 1½ tablespoons of flour to 1 cup of stock)

Heat the stock in a 9 inch saucepan. Dip a spoon in it, fill it with
batter and drop the batter into the stock. Continue doing this until the
dumplings are barely touching. Then cover them and simmer for 2 minutes,
turn them, cook them 2 minutes longer and serve them at once.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                          VEGETABLE DUMPLINGS

Follow the above rule. Add to the batter:

     ½ teaspoon grated onion
     3 tablespoons minced green peppers

                 *        *        *        *        *

                            CHEESE DUMPLINGS

To the above rule for:

       Dumplings

Add:

     2 tablespoons grated cheese

Cook the dumplings in: {pg 375}

       Tomato juice

Thicken this as suggested or dilute tomato soup. If in haste use the
following rule.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                 QUICK CHEESE DUMPLINGS in TOMATO SAUCE

10 two inch dumplings

Combine:

     2 cups biscuit mix
     2 tablespoons grated cheese[1]

Follow the recipe for biscuits as given on the label of the package or
prepare and add the cheese to Biscuit Mix (page 451). Pat or roll out
the dough to the thickness of ⅛ inch. Cut it into 3 inch rounds. Place
in the center of each round:

     1 tablespoon grated cheese

Wet the edges of the rounds with cold water. Gather up the edges to form
a ball. Pinch them well. Drop the dumplings into boiling:

       Thin tomato soup or juice, Stock or Stock Substitute (page 52) or
       bouillon[2]

Cover them tightly with a lid. Steam them for 15 minutes. Subdue your
curiosity and do not lift the lid, no, not even to peek. Serve the
dumplings at once. They may be sprinkled with:

       Chopped parsley

-----

[1] About ⅔ cup grated cheese in all.

[2] This takes an 8 or 9 inch pot and a lot of liquid. I use about 5
cupfuls. It may be slightly thickened but it must not be thick. It is
best to cook your dumplings and then thicken the stock as for Cream
Sauce (page 380) using 1½ tablespoonfuls of butter and the same amount
of flour to every cupful of stock.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                          CORN-MEAL DUMPLINGS

Cooking in the United States is on the up and coming side but it seemed
to me that a peak was reached in a small Kentucky town where I was
served chicken with dumplings. The latter were like thistledown. “Oh
yes!” said the hotel proprietress wearily when I exclaimed over them.
“They are always like that when our colored cook is drunk.”

Far be it from me to limit your sources of inspiration, but I am
convinced that the following rules will give you superlative dumplings
without dissipation.

Sift:

     1 cup corn meal
     ¼ cup bread flour
     1 teaspoon any baking powder
     ½ teaspoon salt

Beat:

     1 egg
     ½ cup milk

Combine the egg mixture and the dry ingredients. Stir in:

     1 tablespoon melted butter

Have simmering:

     5 or 6 cups corned beef stock, consommé or any clear soup or Stock
       (page 50)

Drop the batter by the spoonful into the hot stock. Cover the pan
closely. Simmer the dumplings for 15 minutes. Remove them at once from
the liquor.

                 *        *        *        *        *

    Farina Balls, page 77, make good dumplings.

    Liver Dumplings, page 346.

    Pie Dough, (page 493) cut into strips or shapes, simmered in
    stock, is frequently substituted for a dumpling mixture.

    Remember the good Vegetable Noodles on page 98.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                                CROUTONS

Cut into ½ inch cubes:

       Bread

Sauté the cubes in:

       Hot butter

Stir them gently, or shake the skillet until they are toasted. Serve
them over:

       Noodles (page 98)
       Spaetzle (page 376)
       Potato Dumplings (see below)

or serve them in:

       Soup

                 *        *        *        *        *

                            POTATO DUMPLINGS
                           (KARTOFFELKLOESSE)

These are light and tender, especially good with beef à la mode or other
roast gravy. It is traditional to serve them with Sauerbraten.

Boil uncovered in their jackets until tender:

     6 medium-sized potatoes

Chill them thoroughly for 12 hours or more. Peel them and grate or rice
them. Add:

     2 eggs
    1½ teaspoons salt
     ½ cup flour

Beat the batter with a fork until it is {pg 376}fluffy. Roll it lightly
into balls 1 inch in diameter[1] and drop them into gently boiling
salted water for 10 minutes. Drain them well. Melt:

     ½ cup butter or drippings

Stir in:

     ¼ cup dry bread crumbs

Or prepare:

     ½ cup Croutons (see above)

Pour them over the dumplings.

-----

[1] Many cooks prefer to put the croutons in the balls. Put 1 crouton
into the center of each 1 inch ball. If you wish to make large balls
roll several croutons into each ball.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                          SPATZEN or SPAETZLE
                         (GERMAN EGG DUMPLINGS)

Spatzen are good at any time but they are particularly good served with
roast veal.

Beat:

     2 eggs

Combine them with:

    1½ cups flour
     ½ cup water
     ½ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon any baking powder

Beat these ingredients well. Drop small bits of the batter from a spoon
into simmering salted water, or place it on a plate and cut shreds of
the batter with a knife from the side of the plate into the water, or
put the batter through a colander.

Spatzen should be very light and delicate.

Try out a sample and if it is too heavy, add water to the batter. Simmer
them until they are done. Drain them, place them in a dish and cover
them with:

       Croutons (page 77) or ¼ cup bread crumbs sautéed in ½ cup butter

Spaetzle may be cooked and served in:

       Soup

                 *        *        *        *        *

     1 teaspoon salt
     2 beaten eggs
     2 tablespoons melted fat or butter

Place the batter in a greased oven-proof dish. Bake it in a moderate
oven 325° for about 1 hour. This dish is good with a meat course or
served as a main dish with:

       Mushroom Sauce (page 386) or Tomatoes Creole (page 188), etc.

     1 egg
     1 tablespoon butter
     1 cup buttermilk
     1 teaspoon soda
     ¾ teaspoon salt

Pour the batter into a hot, greased 7 inch baking dish. Bake it in a
moderate oven 350° until it is done, for 30 to 40 minutes. If you wish
to keep the top soft, add from time to time while the bread is baking a
few tablespoonfuls of milk. Use in all for this purpose:

     ½ cup milk or thin cream (sour or sweet)

This will call for longer baking (about 1 hour in all).

                           YORKSHIRE PUDDING

It was customary to cook this old and delicious dish in the pan with the
roast or under the roast, letting the drippings fall upon it. As we now
cook roast beef in a slow oven we must revise the cooking of Yorkshire
pudding. It is best to cook it separately in the hot oven it requires to
puff it up and brown it quickly.[1]

Place the batter in a hot pan containing hot fat or drippings. Cook it
as directed and you will have a dish not unlike a popover. Serve it from
the dish in which it was cooked, cut into squares. Substitute the
pudding for the usual starch served with a main course—potatoes, rice,
spaghetti, etc.

Sift into a bowl:

     ⅞ cup flour
     ½ teaspoon salt

Make a well in the center into which pour:

     ½ cup milk

Stir in the milk. Beat until fluffy:

     2 eggs

Beat them into the batter. Add:

     ½ cup water

Beat the batter well until large bubbles rise to the surface. Permit
this to stand for 1 hour (optional). Beat it again.

Have ready a hot oven-proof dish (about 10 × 10)[2] containing about ¼
inch of hot beef drippings or melted butter. Pour in the batter. It
should be about ⅝ inch high. Bake the pudding in a hot oven 400° for
about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350° and bake it 10 to 15 minutes
longer.

                        Sauces for Meat and Fish
                                 GRAVIES

[Illustration]

Having once been asked my opinion of a newcomer I gave it
unhesitatingly. “She is the kind of person who serves _gray gravy_!”

Sauces are not only the hallmark of the good cook—they are an
indication of her æsthetic sense as well. There is nothing about them
that is synonymous with the bogey man. On the whole they are simple and
in order to excel with them it is necessary to master only one or two
basic principles.

My favorite cooking utensil looks like this and costs ten cents. It is
not an imposing implement, but armed with it you may scoff at lumps and
curdles. It is a tremendous timesaver. Vigorously wielded it will insure
the smoothest of gravies and sauces. I use it in preference to a rotary
beater because its action requires only one hand instead of two, and
because it will do anything a rotary beater can do and more. It is
called a spiral wire whisk and sometimes a spiral egg beater.

                            Stock for Sauces

The word stock usually applies to the liquid gained by simmering meat
(or fish) and vegetables in water. The resulting essence is used in
soups, sauces, aspics, etc.

There are many sources for obtaining stock. An enlightened housekeeper
{pg 378}will keep a jar or other container in her refrigerator in which
to collect the stock that would otherwise be wasted.

Celery tops and parings, bean parings, a few peapods, carrot skins,
parsley stems, a bit of onion, etc., may be combined, barely covered
with water and simmered for about ½ hour. A meat cube may be added to
the strained stock, or it may be used as it is as a basis for a sauce or
soup.

The juices from mild flavored vegetables (peas, beans, asparagus, etc.)
whether freshly cooked or canned should be saved in this way.

The juice from vegetables that are pronounced in flavor, cabbage,
Brussels sprouts, turnips, etc., are too strong for the stock-pot but
they may be kept separately and used as a basis for a soup or a sauce
that is to accompany a coarse dish.

The maintenance of a stock-pot is a bit of thrift that not only
eliminates all waste, but adds materially to the nutritional value of
the food served your family. Remember that vegetable juices are rich in
vitamins.

After the little household economies mentioned above, in behalf of
better gravies come commercial aids that are valuable: meat cubes,
vegetable cubes, condensed broths, essences, pastes, jellies, etc. My
favorites are clear chicken broth and mushroom broth. These combine well
with cream and other ingredients in sauces adding distinction and flavor
to egg, fish and vegetable dishes.

For good gravies keep the following ingredients on hand—all available
juices from cooked or canned food, homemade stock, and the commercial
substitutes listed above.

Plain gravies are of two kinds:

I. Gravy made with drippings in which meat has been sautéed.

II. Gravy made with the juices of stews and roasts.

RULE for MAKING GRAVY with PAN DRIPPINGS in WHICH MEAT HAS BEEN SAUTÉED

1 cupful

Remove the meat from the pan. Place it where it will remain hot. Pour
off all but 2 tablespoonfuls of the drippings. Blend into them:

     1 or 2 tablespoons flour

Stir the gravy with a wire whisk. Add slowly until the gravy has the
right consistency, cooking it slowly and stirring it constantly, about 1
cupful of:

       Hot Stock (page 50), Stock Substitute (page 52), hot milk or hot
       water and cream

Season the gravy with:

       Salt, pepper, minced herbs, fresh or dried, grated lemon rind, etc.
       (see the following Seasonings for Sauces)

Color it with:

       A few drops of Caramel (page 671) or Kitchen Bouquet

Strain the gravy, reheat it and serve it.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                    RULE for MAKING GRAVY for STEWS

Use soup stock, water in which vegetables were cooked, or prepare the
following:

Vegetable Stock

Combine:

     2 cups of water
     1 onion, sliced
       Asparagus scrapings or vegetables that are used in soups
     2 or 3 celery ribs and leaves, chopped
     1 carrot sliced
       Parsley
       Scant seasoning

If the stock is to be used for pot roast or stew bring these ingredients
to the boiling point and pour them over the seared meat.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                    RULE for MAKING GRAVY for ROASTS

About 1 cupful

Modern meat cookery keeps the juices where they should be, in the roast.
You will find very little in the pan. Strain what there is into a tall
{pg 379}receptacle (glass or cup) and place it in cold water. The fat
will rise quickly. Take what you need of it for your gravy measurement.
Skim off the rest and use it later as drippings. The remaining liquid in
the cup will be good for your gravy, but if there is not enough you will
have to add stock (see preceding rule), a diluted meat cube or canned
soup to make up the remainder. Don’t use water unless driven to it.

Melt over low heat:

     3 tablespoons fat

Blend in:

     2 tablespoons flour[1]

Stir in slowly:

     1 cup Stock, (page 50)

Cook and stir the gravy until it is smooth and boiling. Season it with:

       Salt, paprika, pepper, minced herbs, grated lemon rind, etc.

(See the following seasonings for sauces.)

Color it with:

       A few drops of Caramel (page 671) or Kitchen Bouquet

When making gravy from fat meats it will sometimes separate. This looks
calamitous, but it is easily remedied. Add a little cream very slowly,
continue stirring all the time and the gravy will become smooth and
thick. Taste the gravy and if it is not good, make it so. Add paprika,
celery salt, catsup (sparingly).

Stock or meat or vegetable cubes give it character. Having made it good,
a great deal has been accomplished, but not enough—it must also look
good. Keep a bottle of Caramel or Kitchen Bouquet on hand. Add enough of
this to make the gravy a fine color and it is ready to serve. Never
over-season or add unnecessarily to good gravy. Doctor only the
indifferent ones and color them to make them attractive. There is no
excuse, except inefficiency, for whitish, lumpy, tasteless gravies, but
one encounters them, alas! in endless varieties. Therefore these
instructions.

-----

[1] For quick results make a thin paste of flour and water. Keep it in a
covered jar. Stir as much as needed into the hot stock and drippings.
Permit the sauce to boil.

                 Seasonings and Ingredients for Sauces

Sauces can be made interesting in so many different ways by varying the
seasonings and ingredients used. Here are a few suggestions:

       Chopped parsley                      Sautéed mushrooms
       Chopped basil                        Capers
       Chopped tarragon     }               Chopped pickles
       Chopped thyme        }  These may    Chopped lemons
       Chopped chervil      }  be bought    Lemon rind
       Chopped shallot      }  powdered     Lemon juice
       Chopped savory       }               Sherry
       Chopped onion        }               Madeira
       Freshly ground nutmeg                Worcestershire sauce
       2 or 3 cloves (heads removed)        Tabasco sauce
       Part of a bay leaf                   Horseradish, etc.
       Freshly ground pepper                Soy sauce
       Paprika                              Pepper sauce
       Curry powder                         Garlic
       Celery seed                          Leeks
       French celery seed                   Celery salt
       Chili powder                         Onion salt
       Mustard                              Garlic salt

The incomparable “Tilda” of the “funny sheet” says: “There’s many a live
wire around that would be a dead one except for its connections.” Apply
this to indifferent food enlivened by sauces. Remember, _please_, that
there _are_ sauces other than white and brown. {pg 380}

                      CREAM SAUCE or WHITE SAUCE I

1 cupful

This sauce is used for creaming vegetables, fish, etc.

Cream sauce and all its relations are best made in a double boiler. As
this is a rather tedious process, requiring 10 to 15 minutes’ cooking
and stirring, most cooks prefer the shorter way. I do, but I feel
constrained to draw attention to the fact that it is unconventional.

Melt over low heat:

     2 tablespoons butter

Add and blend in:

    1½ to 2 tablespoons flour

Stir in slowly:

     1 cup hot milk[1]

Season these ingredients with:

     ¼ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika or pepper

Cook and stir the sauce with a wire whisk until it is smooth and
boiling. (Combine it with other ingredients when it is boiling so that
it will not become watery.)

-----

[1] Cream may be substituted for milk. The sauce may be made with part
stock and part milk or cream. It may be flavored with a choice of:

       Celery salt
       A grating of nutmeg
     1 teaspoon lemon juice
     ½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
     1 teaspoon sherry
     1 teaspoon onion juice
     2 tablespoons chopped parsley
     2 tablespoons chopped chives

For creamed dishes use about ½ as much sauce as there are solids.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                     HOLLANDAISE SAUCE (Never fail)

1 cupful

My cook calls this “holiday sauce”—isn’t that a grand name for it?
Hollandaise sauce made by this method may be prepared long in advance.
It may be kept hot for a half hour or more over (not in) hot water, or
it may be set aside, chilled and reheated when needed, over (not in) hot
water, provided it is placed in a small crock and is stirred constantly
with a wire whisk until it is hot.

Place where it will melt slowly and keep warm:

     ½ cup butter

The top of the oven is a good place. Heat in the same way:

    1½ tablespoons lemon juice

Have ready a small saucepan of boiling water and a tablespoon with which
to measure it when ready. Find a small bowl or crock that will fit over
the top of a hot water kettle. Have boiling water in the kettle to the
depth of about 1 inch. The bottom of the crock must be well over—not
in—the boiling water. Put the crock on a table. Place in it:

     3 egg yolks

Place the crock on the kettle. Beat the yolks with a wire whisk until
they begin to thicken. Add 1 tablespoonful of boiling water. Beat again
until the eggs begin to thicken. Repeat this process until you have
added in all 4 tablespoonfuls of boiling water. Then beat in the hot
lemon juice. Remove the crock from the fire. Beat the sauce well with a
wire whisk. Beat constantly while adding the melted butter slowly and:

     ¼ teaspoon salt (less if butter is salted)
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika
       A few grains of cayenne

Put the crock back on the kettle in which the water must now be hot but
not boiling. Cover the crock lightly. Beat the sauce again before
serving it. Should the sauce separate—a remote contingency when made in
this way—beat into it gradually:

     1 tablespoon cream

The sauce may be made in the top of a double boiler. Follow this rule
but hold the top container over the steam. Never permit it to touch the
boiling water in the bottom container.

A friend who is a wonder with sauces contributes the following version
of the above Hollandaise Sauce. She says it is excellent and made in one
fell swoop. “Use your favorite recipe as to quantities. Use the top of a
double boiler. Cream all the butter at once. Beat in the egg yolks,
lemon juice and seasonings gradually. Mix well. Stir in the boiling
water slowly. Place the sauce over the bottom of a double boiler in
which 1 inch {pg 382}of water is simmering. Stir well for 5 minutes
until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat and beat for 1 minute.”

                              FIGARO SAUCE

A variation of the well-known Hollandaise sauce.

Prepare:

     1 cup Hollandaise Sauce (page 381)

Beat in very slowly:

     ¼ cup warm tomato pulp

Add:

     2 tablespoons chopped parsley

                 *        *        *        *        *

                         EASY HOLLANDAISE SAUCE

1¼ cupfuls

Soften:

     1 tablespoon butter[1]

Add and beat well:

     3 egg yolks

Add:

     1 teaspoon cornstarch
    1½ teaspoons lemon juice

Just before serving the sauce add very, very slowly:

     1 cup boiling water

Hold the pan over boiling water, or high over a low flame and stir the
sauce until it thickens. Add:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon paprika

This sauce may be placed over (not in) hot water until ready for use. It
may be reheated over very slow heat. Stir it constantly.

          Sauces Made with Canned Soups and Other Quick Sauces

Good quick sauces may be made with canned soup (or, if a household is
very small, for reasons of economy with powdered soup). You may purchase
canned gravies of various kinds and sauces galore, but even the most
limited emergency shelf is apt to boast a tin or two of canned soup—so
we shall rank that first as a basis for emergency gravy.

It is a little difficult to write about canned soups in a sweeping way
because they have not the same consistency. Some are thicker than
{pg 393}others (also some people like a thick gravy and others a thin
one). The best I can urge upon you is to make a selection of the same
soup made by various companies, to determine your preference, then keep
that particular brand on hand for future use.

The thick soups may be thinned to the consistency you like with milk,
cream or stock. The thinner soups may be thickened by melting a
tablespoonful or two of butter in a pan, stirring in the same amount of
flour and then slowly stirring in the soup and cooking it until it
boils.

As to seasoning, that is an individual matter. Most soups converted into
gravies require little additional seasoning, but if you like your gravy
sharp, add it by all means. You will find suggestions for the usual (and
a few unusual) seasonings in the chapter on Gravy (page 377).

                     SAUCES MADE with CANNED SOUPS

Heat the contents of:

     1 (10½ oz.) can condensed soup (mushroom, celery, asparagus, pea,
       etc.)

It may be just the consistency you like for gravy. If not, thin it with
about:

     6 tablespoons milk or stock

Or, thicken (like Cream Sauce):

       Ready-to-serve soup

with about:

    1½ tablespoons butter and the same amount of flour

For a highly seasoned sauce add:

       Red pepper, chili, Tabasco or Worcestershire sauce

For a more sophisticated sauce add, after removing the sauce from the
fire:

     2 tablespoons sherry

For a fish sauce dilute the sauce with:

     ¼ cup or more white wine or add 1 tablespoon lemon juice

Do not permit the sauce to boil after adding the wine. For a variation
add:

     ¼ teaspoon or more curry powder or dry mustard
     1 tablespoon horseradish or a pinch or two of dried herb

For a creole sauce add finely chopped or grated:

       Green pepper
       Onion
       Celery

You may add:

       Chopped pickles, peppers or capers

and anything that appeals to you that will give your sauce distinction.

To achieve this follow your feminine hunch with abandon. After all, one
need not be inhibited about a sauce that is to be eaten en famille.

                            CINNAMON APPLES

4 Servings

Pare and core:

     4 Rome Beauty apples

Boil in a saucepan:

     ½ cup sugar
     1 cup water
     ¼ cup (⅛ pound) cinnamon drops

When the cinnamon drops are dissolved add the apples slowly one at a
time. Cook them gently until they are tender. Test them with a straw.
Remove them from the sirup. Fill the hollows with:

       Blanched almonds or other nut meats and raisins (optional)

Boil the sirup until it falls heavily from a spoon. Pour it over the
apples. Chill them.

                           GREEN MINT APPLES

4 Servings

Prepare the preceding:

       Cinnamon Apples

Substitute for the cinnamon drops:

     2 drops peppermint oil
       A very little green vegetable coloring

                 *        *        *        *        *

                 APPLE CUPS FILLED with SWEET POTATOES

These are lovely to look at and good to eat. (I like them tart.) They
may be prepared in advance—another virtue.

Prepare by the preceding rule, omitting the cinnamon drops:

       Large red or yellow apples

When cool enough to handle, hollow the apples. Reserve the removed pulp.
Prepare by the rule on page 257:

    1¼ cups Mashed Sweet Potatoes

Mash the apple pulp and add it to the sweet potatoes with:

     1 or 2 tablespoons brown sugar

Fill the apples. Decorate the tops with:

       Nut meats (optional)

Refrain if possible but, if you cannot, cover the tops with
marshmallows. (I am not putting them in the ingredient column because
they are less likely to be seen here). Place the apples in a baking dish
with a little of the apple sirup. Reheat them in a moderate oven 375°
for 10 minutes. If the apples are prepared in advance cover them with
waxed paper. If they have become chilled it will take longer to reheat
them. Baste them with apple sirup. If there is no other decoration
garnish the tops with:

       Sprigs of parsley

                       BAKED APPLES and MINCEMEAT

Wash and core:

       Apples

Hollow them—leave a shell ⅓ inch thick. Chop the pulp and combine it
with:

       Mincemeat

Add:

       Brown sugar (allow 1 tablespoon or more for each apple)

Fill the apples. Place them in a baking dish with:

       Water (allow 1 tablespoon for each apple)

Sprinkle the apples with:

       Brown sugar

Bake them in a moderate oven 350° until they are done. Baste them
frequently. These apples may be served as a dessert with or without:

       Hard Sauce (page 670)

Flavor the sauce with:

       Brandy or sherry

                 *        *        *        *        *

                      BAKED PEACHES and MINCEMEAT

Drain:

       Canned peaches

Fill each half with:

       Mincemeat

Place the peach halves in a shallow pan with enough peach juice to keep
them from scorching. Bake them in a slow oven for 25 or 30 minutes.
Serve them with roast fowl or ham. {pg 398}

                            BROILED PEACHES

This and the above—Baked Peaches and Mincemeat—make a good garnish for
a meat platter.

Drain:

       Canned peaches

Place them, hollow side up, in a shallow pan. Place in each hollow:

       A dab of butter

Sprinkle each peach lightly with:

       Salt

Broil the peaches under a moderate flame until they are light brown.

                               APPLESAUCE

Wash and cut into quarters:

       Apples

Place them in a saucepan and partly cover them with water. Old apples
require more water than new ones. New apples require very little water.
Add to tasteless[1] apples:

       Sliced lemon

Stew the apples until they are tender. Put them through a purée strainer
or ricer. Return the strained apples to the saucepan. Add enough:

       Sugar

to make them palatable. Boil them for 3 minutes. Sprinkle the apple
sauce, if desired, with:

       Cinnamon

Serve it hot or cold. If served hot add:

     1 to 2 teaspoon butter

If served cold add:

     ½ teaspoon vanilla or a few drops of almond extract

If applesauce is to be served with pork add:

     1 or 2 tablespoons horseradish

                    SAUTÉED APPLES (“Fried Apples”)

The following recipe is good only when made with tart, well-flavored
apples. Then it is delicious.

Core and slice:

     6 large apples[1]

Melt in a skillet over a quick fire:

     2 tablespoons butter or bacon drippings

When it is hot, add the apples. Cover them until they are steaming.
Sprinkle the apples with:

     ½ cup sugar
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Cook them covered over a gentle fire until they are nearly tender. If
the apples are dry a little hot water may be added. Uncover them and
cook them until they are tender. Add additional butter as needed. Serve
the apples with a meat course or with:

       Bacon

-----

[1] Ripe firm peaches peeled may be substituted. Onion lovers may begin
making this dish by placing a layer of onions (about 1 cupful) in the
butter. Cook them slowly for 5 minutes. Season with salt and paprika.
Add the apples, sugar and salt and proceed as directed.

                              APPLE RINGS

Wash, core and cut crosswise into slices:

     3 large perfect cooking apples

Heat in a skillet:

     3 tablespoons bacon fat or butter

Place in it a single layer of apple rings. Sprinkle them lightly with:

       Powdered sugar

Add to the skillet:

     2 tablespoons water

Cover the skillet and cook the apples until they are tender. Remove the
cover and brown the rings on both sides. Serve them hot, the centers
filled with:

       Bright red jelly

Or dust the rings with:

       Cinnamon

                             BAKED BANANAS

Butter, sugar, lemon juice and salt are called for in most recipes for
baked bananas. These additions are good but optional.

Peel:

       Bananas

Place them in a well-greased baking {pg 399}dish. Bake them in a
moderate oven 350° until they are very tender (about 30 minutes). Season
them with:

       Salt (optional)

If desired sprinkle them after baking with:

       Lemon juice
       Confectioner’s sugar

Bananas may be baked in their skins. Bake them in a moderate oven 375°
for about 20 minutes.

                      SAUTÉED or BROILED PINEAPPLE

Drain and dry between towels:

       Large slices of canned pineapple

Cut them into halves. Dip them in:

       Flour

Heat in a skillet:

       Butter or bacon drippings

Sauté the pineapple in the fat. Serve the slices hot. Use them with:

                    BOILED ORANGES (STEWED ORANGES)

6 Servings

Wash and cut into halves or thick slices crosswise:

     3 navel oranges

Place them in a saucepan. Pour over them:

       Boiling water to cover

Cook them for 1 hour. Drain them well. Discard the water. Cook for 5
minutes:

     1 cup sugar
    1¼ cups water
     3 tablespoons lemon juice

Place the oranges in the sirup. Cook them until they are tender, for
about 1 hour. Place them in a jar in the sirup. Keep them in a cold
place until ready to use them. The centers may be slightly hollowed and
filled with:

       Crushed pineapple, chopped nut meats, maraschino cherries or a dab
       of tart jelly

These oranges are very good served {pg 400}with baked ham, spoon bread
and a green salad.

                            BAKED ORANGES I

Select medium-sized:

       Oranges

Soak them for 12 hours in cold water. Cut off the tops and take out the
cores. Loosen the peel with a knife to the depth of 1½ inches. Fill the
centers with:

       Sugar
     1 tablespoon butter

Place the oranges in a baking pan half full of water, cover them and
bake them slowly until they are done (for about 2 hours) in a 325° oven.
Remove the cover and brown them slightly. They may be topped with:

       Marshmallows

The marshmallows may be roasted. As I do not belong to the marshmallow
school of cooking, I prefer seasoning the oranges with:

       Sherry

The juice in the pan may be thickened with:

       Flour (see Gravy, page 377)

Heat it to the boiling point, stir it constantly and flavor it with
sherry.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                            BAKED ORANGES II

Wash:

       Thin-skinned oranges of even size

Soak them for 12 hours in cold water. Cut a slice from the top of each
orange and remove the meat. Remove the fiber and the seeds from the pulp
and chop it. Add an equal measure of:

       Crushed pineapple, drained

Sweeten it with:

       Sugar

Fill the shells with the mixture. Put on each orange:

     1 tablespoon butter

Place them in a baking dish. Cover them closely and bake them in a slow
oven 325° until the skins are tender—for about 2 hours.

Refill the shells as the filling cooks down and baste the oranges
frequently with:

       Pineapple juice

                 *        *        *        *        *

                   CANNED PEARS, PEACHES or APRICOTS

Drain:

       Canned pears, peaches or apricots

Fill them with:

       Mint or other jelly

Use them to garnish a platter or plate. You may add butter to the fruit
and heat it gently before adding the jelly. Whole canned apricots are
good stuffed with cream cheese, to which you may add grated onion or
chopped nut meats.

              ORANGE SLICES with JELLY or CRANBERRY JELLY

Wash and cut into ⅓ inch slices:

     2 oranges

Remove the seeds. Cover the slices with:

       Tart jelly, mint or cranberry Jelly (page 394)

Mold the cranberry jelly in a straight glass. Unmold it, cut it into
slices and cover the orange slices with the cranberry jelly. Try to have
it the same size as the orange slices. These slices are very decorative
on a platter or for individual plate service.

                            BOILED KUMQUATS

Place:

     1 quart kumquats

in water to cover well. Bring them to the boiling point. Drain them.
Repeat this process twice so that the kumquats will have been boiled in
three waters. Boil them in the last water until they are tender. Boil
for 5 minutes:

     ¾ cup water
     2 cups sugar

Cook the kumquats in this sirup for 5 minutes. The kumquats may be
served whole or they may be cut into halves, in which case remove the
seeds. Chill the kumquats thoroughly. Use them as a garnish for a meat
platter or in salads.

                             FROSTED GRAPES

Very decorative on top of a Christmas basket or fruit bowl.

Beat until slightly frothy:

     1 egg white

Spread it on a bunch of grapes. Sprinkle them with:

       Granulated sugar

Permit the sugar to dry. Tie a bow of silver or white gauze ribbon
around the main stem of the grapes. You may shock the garden club by
using sprays of ivy as a garnish. Very pretty, if somewhat irregular.

                              Dried Fruits

Modern methods of dehydrating have removed the necessity of long soaking
of dried fruits. Wash them in several waters (lukewarm) or until the
water is clear.

                                APRICOTS

Wash:

     1 pound dried apricots

Add:

     4 cups water

Simmer the fruit for 35 minutes. Add:

     2 cups sugar

Boil the fruit 5 minutes longer.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                                  FIGS

Wash and remove the stems from:

     1 pound dried figs

Add:

       Cold water to cover well
    1½ tablespoons lemon juice
       A piece of lemon rind
       A large piece of ginger root (optional)

Stew the figs covered until they are soft. Drain them. Measure the
juice. Add:

     ½ as much sugar as there is juice

Simmer the sirup until it is thick. Add:

     1 tablespoon lemon juice

Replace the figs in the sirup. Cook them for 1 minute. Cool them. Add:

     1 tablespoon sherry (optional)

Chill them and serve them with:

       Cream

                 *        *        *        *        *

                                 PRUNES

Cover with hot water and soak for 1 hour:

     1 pound dried prunes

Bring them to the boiling point in the water in which they were soaked.
Cook them gently for 30 minutes. Add:

     ¼ cup or more sugar

Cook them 10 minutes longer. Optional addition to prunes while cooking:

     ½ lemon sliced
     1 stick cinnamon

                 *        *        *        *        *

                             SPICED PRUNES

These prunes are deliciously spiced and their piquant quality makes them
a good addition to a meat course.

Prepare prunes by the preceding rule. Cook them for 30 minutes. Drain
them. Prepare the following sirup. Combine and boil for 5 minutes:

     1 cup brown sugar
     ½ cup vinegar
     1 lemon sliced
       A few grains of salt
     2 inches stick cinnamon
     1 teaspoon nutmeg, allspice and cloves (combined)

Add the drained prunes and cook them for 3 minutes. Cool them. Place
them in a covered jar in a cold place for 3 days.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                     PRUNES or APRICOTS on SKEWERS

Steam until nearly tender in a double boiler or in a covered colander
over boiling water:

       Large prunes or apricots

Remove the stones. Stuff the prunes or apricots with prunes or with
pieces of:

       Canned pineapple, drained
       Unbroken nut meats

Place 2 or more prunes on a skewer. Surround them with:

       Slices of bacon

Place them on a broiler under a moderate flame. Turn them frequently and
cook them until the bacon is crisp.

Or, alternate on skewers:

       Steamed apricots and prunes

(Pit the prunes. They may be stuffed as suggested above.) Roll the
skewers in:

       Melted butter
       Brown sugar

Bake them in a greased pan in a moderate oven, 325° to 350° with a
roast, duck, etc. for about 15 minutes. Turn them once. Sprinkle them
with:

       Brown sugar

Broil the fruit under a moderate flame until glazed.

                                Lettuce

Lettuce, endive and watercress should be served crisp and cold. They
{pg 402}should be dressed immediately before being served (except in the
case of wilted lettuce).

Soak the heads of lettuce in cold water for one hour. Separate the
leaves, wash them well, drain or shake the water from them and place
them in a bag on ice. See page 245, for keeping vegetables fresh in a
mechanical refrigerator. When ready to serve the lettuce, add the
dressing, or prepare the dressing at the table and add it to the
lettuce.

Watercress calls for the same treatment. The stalks are cut off shortly
before it is served, and the coarse leaves are sometimes removed.

Heads of Iceberg lettuce are not separated. They are cut into
wedge-shaped pieces or into crosswise slices.

A little garlic is a popular flavoring for green salads. A wit has said
that there is no such thing, but there are two ways of giving to salad a
delicate touch of this pungent product. Split a clove of garlic and rub
the inside of the salad bowl with it, or cut a one and a half inch cube
of rather dry or toasted bread or a small crust of bread and rub the
bread on all sides with a split clove of garlic. Place the bread in the
bowl with the salad ingredients. Add the dressing and toss the salad
lightly to distribute it. Serve the salad at once.

Remember, please, that there are endless ways of varying a lettuce salad
(lettuce in this case includes endive, romaine, etc.) See the many
versions of French dressing in the chapter on Salad Dressings.

A bit of cream, catsup, horseradish, anchovy, potato or cheese may
transfigure an otherwise commonplace dish, and chopped chives, parsley,
or other herb, fresh or dried (see Herbs, page 763), may make it the
success of the meal. Sliced hard-cooked eggs or radishes, chopped
olives, nutmeats, pimiento or green pepper, sardelle or anchovy,
slivered or grated carrots, celery, onions, ham, tongue, chicken, curry,
chutney and many other additions may be made to French dressing, boiled
salad dressing or mayonnaise. Please read the rule for French Dressing
on page 440. {pg 403}

                            HERRING SALAD II

8 Servings

Unusual and delicious. Begin its preparation one day before serving the
salad.

Cut into ½ inch pieces:

     9 large milter[1] herring

Add:

     2 apples, thinly sliced
     3 large salt pickles, thinly sliced
     ¾ cup sugar
     1 cup broken pecan meats

Shortly before serving whip until it begins to thicken then fold in:

     2 cups heavy cream

[1] You may use the herring put up in glass.


                                Tomatoes

A bit of tomato skin was once as much out of place at a dinner table as
a bowie knife. The discovery that tomato skins contain highly valued
vitamins makes them _salonfaehig_, so whether to serve tomatoes skinned
or unskinned rests with the hostess’ sense of delicacy or her desire for
health. After all, tomato skins are rather uninviting.

                       RULE FOR SKINNING TOMATOES

Wash tomatoes. Peel them by one of the following methods:

I. Rub the surface of very ripe tomatoes with the back of a knife, then
pull off the skin with a knife.

II. Immerse tomatoes in boiling water for 2 minutes. Drain them and skin
them.

III. Place a tomato on a fork over heat. The skin will crack and it is
then easily removed.

                              TOMATO SALAD

Skin and chill:

       Tomatoes

Cut them from the top into quarters or eighths, but do not cut them all
the way through (or slice the tomatoes).

Serve them on:

       Lettuce

with:

       French dressing

The centers may be filled with:

       Diced cucumbers
       Chopped celery
       Cream cheese
       Nut meats, etc.

Substitute for French dressing, if desired:

       Mayonnaise, boiled sour cream dressing, Anchovy dressing, etc.

                 *        *        *        *        *

         RULE for PREPARING and FILLING TOMATO CASES for SALAD

Skin:

       Tomatoes (see above)

Hollow them. Sprinkle the hollows with:

       Salt

If you do not wish to serve large portions cut the tomatoes in halves or
in slices. Place on each slice a ring of green pepper ½ inch or more
thick. Fill the ring with any one of the fillings suggested for tomato
cases.

8 Servings

Cook:

     8 large Artichokes (page 289)

Add to the water in which they are boiled:

     ¼ cup vinegar

When the artichokes have been drained and cooled spread the leaves
outward. Pull out the tight conical center of the leaves. Scrape out the
choke (the thorny, fuzzy substance) with a teaspoon.

Combine the following salad mixture:

     3 cups crabmeat[1]
    1¾ cups chopped celery
     ¼ cup finely chopped green pepper
     ¾ cup mayonnaise
     2 tablespoons chopped chives or parsley (optional)

Fill the artichokes. Decorate each one with:

     1 tablespoon mayonnaise

As the leaves are removed they are dipped in the mayonnaise. This leaves
the remaining salad to be eaten with the artichoke hearts.

[1] Shrimp or lobster may be substituted or even the overworked tuna
fish. If you do not care for fish use cooked chicken or veal, diced.
Almost any palatable salad mixture that is not sweet will do.

Any clever person can take a few desolate-looking icebox left-overs and
glorify them into a tempting aspic salad. For utilizing left-overs an
aspic is second only to a soufflé—well-combined scraps resulting in a
dish that is sometimes as good as one composed of delicacies.

Use:

    Cooked diced meat              Pickles
    Cooked flaked fish             Diced cucumbers
    Hard-cooked eggs               Diced celery
    Cooked sweetbreads             Cooked celeriac
    Shredded cabbage               Sliced green peppers
    Nut meats                      Canned asparagus
    Cooked beets                   Seedless grapes
    Cooked or raw carrots          Cranberries, halved
    Skinned grapefruit sections    Chopped parsley, chives, mint or
                                     other herbs (see page 763)

Cover the tongue with fresh water. Add:

     1 onion, sliced
     ½ cup chopped celery with leaves
     3 bay leaves

     1 cup chopped celery
     ½ cup chopped green peppers

Have ready a mold or bread pan that has been moistened with cold water.
Place a small amount of aspic in the bottom of the mold. If desired mold
into this sliced eggs, carrots, cooked beets, canned mushrooms, etc. Put

it. When well chilled unmold the aspic on a platter. Garnish it with:

       Lettuce leaves

8 Servings

This dish (my own palate-child) has saved my life—at least my
reputation—on so many occasions that I dedicate it gratefully with all
good wishes to any hostess, caught in a pinch.

Proportions are unimportant for this refreshing, quickly made salad and
ingredients may be altered freely to suit the cook’s taste or materials
on hand. Celery, olives, hard-cooked eggs, etc., may be added.

Drain, reserving the juices:

     1 (No. 2) can grapefruit sections
     1 (10½ oz.) can asparagus, green or white
     1 (6½ oz.) can crabmeat or shrimp

Cut the asparagus into pieces. Pick over the crabmeat or remove the
intestinal vein from the shrimp. Add to the juices to make 2¾ cupfuls of
liquid:

       Chicken broth, Stock (page 50), canned consommé or dissolved
       chicken bouillon cubes

Soak:

    1½ tablespoons gelatine

in:

     ½ cup of this liquid

Dissolve it in:

     1 cup of hot liquid

Combine the gelatine and the remaining liquid. Season well with the:

       Juice of 1 or more lemons or with ¼ cup dry white wine

Add if needed:

       Salt

You may add:

     3 or more tablespoons capers, caper liquor

Chill the gelatine until it begins to thicken. Have ready an oiled mold.
Pour part of the gelatine into it, sprinkle some grapefruit, crab and
asparagus over it, then alternate layers of gelatine and the other
ingredients. Wind up with gelatine on top. Chill the aspic until it is
very cold. Serve it on:

       Lettuce

with:

       Herb mayonnaise (page 444)

                             FISH in ASPIC

8 Servings

This and the preceding rule may be {pg 429}classed with my three-star
recipes. Prepare for cooking (see page 226), then cut into 4 or 5
pieces:

       A fish weighing about 2½ pounds

Bring to the boiling point:

     5 cups water
     3 or 4 ribs of celery with leaves
     1 small onion, sliced
     4 or 5 sprigs of parsley
     3 tablespoons lemon juice
     1 inch of lemon rind
     3 peppercorns
     ½ teaspoon dried herbs (tarragon, basil, etc.)
     ½ teaspoon paprika
     1 teaspoon salt

Drop the fish into the boiling stock. Simmer it until it is tender. Do
not permit it to boil at any time. This is a quick process requiring
only 5 minutes or so. Test the fish (see page 226). Remove it at once
from the stock. Strain the stock. There should be about 3½ cupfuls. If
there is not, add water, chicken stock, etc. Soak:

     2 tablespoons gelatine

in:

     ¼ cup cold fish stock

Dissolve it in the hot stock. Add:

     2 tablespoons or more capers
     1 tablespoon caper juice

Season the stock well with:

       Salt
       Paprika
       Lemon juice or dry white wine

Chill it until it begins to thicken. Remove the skin and bone from the
fish. Leave it in large flakes or pieces. Place a layer of aspic in a
wet mold, cover it with flaked fish and repeat this process until the
ingredients are all used. Wind up with aspic on top. Chill the aspic.
Serve it very cold with:

       Mayonnaise (page 444) or sour cream

To either of which you may add:

     1 or 2 tablespoons chopped herbs (chives, tarragon, parsley, etc.)
       Diced cucumbers

This makes a fine main dish. Decorate the platter with watercress or
shredded lettuce, surround it with deviled eggs, radishes and olives.
Serve with it:

       Luncheon Bread (page 471) or Garlic Bread (page 79)

                          Dressings for Salads

                        RULE FOR FRENCH DRESSING

There are many variations of French dressing, but the basis is usually:

     ¾ part oil
     ¼ part vinegar or lemon juice
       Salt
       Pepper or paprika

These proportions and the seasoning may be varied. To keep French
dressing place it in a tightly closed jar. Shake the jar well before
using the dressing.

Onion and garlic add flavor to French dressing. A clove of garlic,
peeled, may be placed in a quart of vinegar for six or seven days. The
clove is then removed and the delicately flavored vinegar is used for
dressings,[1] or the bowl in which a dressing is to be made may be
rubbed with garlic. Very finely minced or grated onion or onion juice
may be substituted for garlic, or the dressing may be made without
either.

There are variously flavored vinegars that add distinction to salad
dressing: garlic vinegar, wine vinegar, malt vinegar, tarragon vinegar,
spiced vinegar, etc.

Please read the chapter on Lettuce, page 402. In addition to the
ingredients suggested do not hesitate to add others, such as
Worcestershire sauce, chili sauce, chutney, a dash of curry powder, ½
teaspoon or more of dried or fresh herbs, sour or sweet cream or cottage
cheese.

       A few grains of cayenne
     ½ teaspoon vinegar or lemon juice

Beat in very slowly ½ teaspoonful at a time:

     ½ cup olive oil

Combine in a cup or small pitcher:

    1½ tablespoons vinegar
     2 tablespoons lemon juice

Beat into the dressing ½ teaspoonful at a time:

     ½ cup olive oil

Alternate the oil with a few drops of the lemon and vinegar mixture. If
the ingredients are cold and are added slowly during constant beating
this will make a good thick dressing. In summer place the bowl in which
the dressing is being made over cracked ice. Should the dressing
separate place 1 egg yolk in a bowl. Stir it constantly and add the
dressing to it very, very slowly at first, and slowly as the mixture
thickens.

If the dressing is too heavy thin it with:

       Cream or whipped cream[1]

When making mayonnaise with an electric beater, beat the egg yolks at
medium speed for 4 minutes. Combine the dry ingredients and add them.
Add 1½ tablespoonfuls of cold water. Adjust the oil dripper. Place ½ of
the oil in the container. Add the oil drop by drop. When the dressing
begins to thicken add the lemon juice. Place the remaining oil in the
container. Let it flow more freely. Beat constantly at medium speed.
Time required, about 20 minutes.

Three recipes for boiled salad dressing are given. No. I, made with 1
egg or 2 yolks, is a very economical, acceptable boiled dressing. It may
be thinned with cream, but is good as it is over vegetable and potato
salad. No. II is made with milk and 2 whole eggs. No. III is made
without eggs. These dressings are good over slaw, tomatoes, aspics, etc.

Sprinkle flour on a pan and place it in a heated oven.

If it turns a _delicate brown_ in five minutes the oven is _slow_—250°
to 325°.

If it turns a _medium golden brown_ in five minutes the oven is
_moderate_—325° to 400°.

If it turns a _deep dark brown_ in five minutes the oven is _hot_—400°
to 450°.

If it turns a _deep dark brown_ in three minutes the oven is _very
hot_—450° to 500°.

A piece of white tissue-paper may be used in place of the flour.


                         Rule for Baking Powder

When confronted with the questions growing out of the use of the various
forms of baking powder now on the market the puzzled layman is apt to
sigh for the good old days when this article was made at home, rather
haphazardly, from a formula handed from one generation to the other.

Had I died in 1933 baking powder would have been found written on my
heart. Due to the complexity of the problem it became one of life’s
major issues.

When William Beebe’s nerves became overwrought due to the study of the
personal relationships of birds, he turned from them to occupy himself
with the habits of the less emotional fishes. I had no such outlet. I
had to battle with many new things, to discover that calcium phosphate
baking powder while not necessarily so labeled has a double
{pg 448}action, that both calcium and tartrate baking powders may be
used in smaller amounts than usually designated in recipes without other
harm to the baked product than a slightly smaller volume, that when eggs
are added to a batter the usual measurement of one teaspoonful of baking
powder to a cupful of flour may be reduced, etc., etc.

I do not pretend to have solved the baking powder problem scientifically
but endless experiments have enabled me to solve it to my own present
satisfaction.

Baking powders come under the following general classifications:

     _Tartrate Baking Powder_
     _Calcium Phosphate Baking Powder_
     _Combination Type or Double Acting Baking Powder_ (also called S. A.
       S.)

Look at the label of your baking-powder can. There you will find
distinctly marked the type of baking powder you are using.

The recipes in this book will tell you plainly how much of each type of
baking powder I find it advisable to use to make a successful bread or
cake.


                     Soda—Sour Milk and Sweet Milk

_Sour milk_ may be used in recipes calling for sweet milk.

To each cup of:

       Sour milk[1]

Allow from: ¼ to ½ teaspoon soda (according to the acidity of the milk)
and proceed as directed in the recipe. Sift the soda with the dry
ingredients.

_Sweet milk_ may be used in recipes calling for sour milk.

To each cup of:

       Warm sweet milk

Add:

    1½ tablespoons lemon juice or
    1½ tablespoons vinegar

and proceed as directed in the recipe.

-----

[1] Sour milk is best for baking purposes when it has reached the
clabbered stage. The curd is thick and heavy, and the whey has not
separated to any great extent. It should be kept in a clean, covered
container. If milk is placed in the refrigerator as soon as it reaches
the clabbered stage, it will remain in this condition for three or four
days and it may be used as needed.

One-half teaspoon baking soda with one cup clabbered milk will leaven
two cups flour.

Buttermilk may be substituted for clabbered milk.

One cup heavy sour cream may be substituted for one-third cup butter and
two-thirds cup milk in any sour milk recipe.

One cup thin sour cream may be substituted for three tablespoons butter
and three-fourths cup milk in any sour milk recipe.

Baking soda should not be mixed with the sour milk because in this way
some of the gas that should go to leaven the product is lost. Baking
soda should be sifted with the flour. This is an important factor in the
{pg 449}success of baking soda recipes. _Treat baking soda as a dry
ingredient._


                   General Rules and Terms for Baking

_Preheat the    to the degree given in the recipe before placing the
  Oven:_        dough in it.
_Ingredients:_  Have all ingredients at room temperature.
_To Beat:_      Mix with vigorous strokes with a circular over-and-over
                motion.
_To Blend:_     Combine ingredients until they are thoroughly mixed.
_To Cream:_     Combine shortening and sugar with a slotted spoon or with
                the hand until these ingredients are well blended and
                fluffy—like whipped cream. Use butter that has been in
                room temperature long enough to be fairly soft. Take care
                that it is not very soft or melted for that will make it
                oily (unless the recipe calls for melted butter). To
                measure shortening pack it firmly into the cup. When
                melted shortening is called for melt it before measuring.
_To Cut in:_    Combine butter or shortening with flour by cutting the
                fat into the flour with a pastry blender or two knives
                until it is reduced to small particles.
_To Dredge:_    Cover the ingredients completely with flour or crumbs.
_To Fold in:_   This usually applies to ingredients into which air has
                been beaten and in which you wish to retain the air. Fold
                the heavier into the lighter mixture by a downward and
                over action enclosing all the air possible until the
                ingredients are blended. See Cakes (page 524).
_To Grease:_    Spread cake pans or tins with unsalted fat (or beeswax
                for cookies).
_To Knead:_     Press dough with the palms of the hands, then fold the
                farthest edge to the center. Repeat this action, turning
                the dough as you knead it.
_To Stir:_      Mix with a flat circular motion.
_To Whip:_      This applies to the whites of eggs or to heavy cream.
                Beat lightly with a circular over-and-over motion to
                incorporate air.
_To Work:_      Combine rather stiff ingredients with a spoon or the hand
                until they hold together.
_To Blanch      Pour boiling water over shelled almonds. Permit them to
  Almonds:_     stand for five minutes. Drain them. Pour cold water over
                them and slip off the skins.
_Eggs:_         Eggs that have been for some time at room temperature
                will beat more quickly and lightly than eggs that are
                very cold. If you are changing the amount of a recipe and
                you run into a puzzler like dividing five eggs—beat up
                one egg and divide it.
_To Fill:_      Allow for the rising of bread, cake, soufflés, etc. Fill
                pans only two-thirds full.
_To Measure     Pack it firmly into the cup.
  Brown Sugar:_
_To Measure     _Pour_ it into the spoon or cup. If you immerse the spoon
  Molasses,     or cup the liquid will cling to the bottom and sides and
  Sirup or      your measurement will be inaccurate.
  Honey:_
_To Scald       Put it in a saucepan over slow heat or in a double
  Milk:_        boiler. It is scalded when small beads appear around the
                edge.


                                Biscuits

About 24 one and a half inch biscuits

Use chilled shortening and liquids. {pg 450}Sift before measuring:

     2 cups cake flour or 1¾ cups bread flour

Resift with:

     1 teaspoon salt
     4 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 2 teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)

Add:

     ¾ tablespoon lard[1]
     1 tablespoon butter

Cut the shortening into the dry ingredients with a pastry blender, or
two knives, until the mixture is the consistency of coarse corn meal.
Make a well in the center of these ingredients. Pour into it:

     ⅔ to ¾ cup milk or milk and water

Stir the milk in cautiously until there is no danger of spilling it,
then stir it vigorously until the dough is fairly free from the sides of
the bowl. The time for stirring should be a scant ½ minute. Turn the
dough onto a lightly floured board. Knead it gently and quickly for a
scant ½ minute.

Roll the dough with a lightly floured rolling pin or pat it gently with
the palm of the hand until it has the desired thickness—about ¼ inch is
right for a plain biscuit, ½ inch or less for a tea biscuit and 1 inch
or more for shortcake. Cut the dough with a biscuit cutter. If it sticks
dip the cutter in a very little flour.

Brush the tops of the biscuits with:

       Milk or melted butter (optional)

Use a spatula to place them on a greased baking sheet. Biscuits may be
prepared ahead of time. Cover them with waxed paper and place them in
the refrigerator for several hours or until ready to use. Bake them in a
quick oven 425° until done (for about 12 minutes—a little longer if
they have been chilled).

To reheat biscuits, place them in a paper bag, close the bag and place
it in a quick oven 425°, or sprinkle a very little water on the biscuits
and reheat them in a covered double boiler.

-----

[1] The amount of shortening may be increased to 5 tablespoonfuls in all
if a richer dough is preferred.

                             DROP BISCUITS

The kneading and rolling called for in the preceding rule are avoided in
this emergency recipe. These biscuits are less shapely but are equally
palatable.

Add to the preceding rule for Biscuits:

     2 tablespoons or more milk

Stir the dough for a scant minute. Drop it by the spoonful on a greased
baking sheet. Follow the preceding rule for baking and reheating
biscuits.

                            BEATEN BISCUITS

The following lines by Howard Weeden (_Bandanna Ballads_) sum up in a
nutshell the art of making biscuits:

                “Of course I’ll gladly give de rule
                  I meks beat biscuit by,
                Dough I ain’t sure dat you will mek
                  Dat bread the same as I.

                “’Case cookin’s like religion is—
                  Some’s ’lected an’ some ain’t,
                An’ rules don’t no more mek a cook
                  Den sermons mek a Saint.”

Sift three times:

     4 cups bread flour
     1 teaspoon salt[1]
     1 tablespoon sugar

Cut into the flour with a pastry blender or two knives:

     4 tablespoons chilled lard

When these ingredients are the consistency of corn meal add to make a
stiff dough:

       Equal parts of chilled milk and ice water, approximately 1 cupful

Knead the dough with a biscuit machine, or beat it with a mallet until
it is well blistered. This is a long process requiring half an hour or
more. (Mr. Weeden’s verse goes on to say:

                 “Two hundred licks is what I gives
                   For home-folks, never fewer,
                 An’ if I’m ’specting company in,
                   I gives five hundred sure!”)

When the dough is smooth and glossy, roll it to the thickness of ½ inch
and cut it with a biscuit cutter. Spread the tops with:

       Melted butter

Pierce through the biscuits with a fork. Bake them in a slow oven 325°
for about 30 minutes.

Into:

     ¾ cup cooked mashed sweet potatoes

Beat:

     4 tablespoons melted butter

Stir in:

     ⅔ cup milk

Sift, then measure:

    1¼ cups bread flour

Resift with:

     4 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 2 teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)
     1 tablespoon sugar
     ½ teaspoon salt

Stir the sifted ingredients into the sweet potato mixture. Turn the
dough out on a floured board and toss it lightly until it is smooth on
the outside. Roll or pat it to the thickness of ½ inch. Cut it into
shapes with a floured biscuit cutter. Bake the biscuits on a greased pan
in a hot oven 450° for about 15 minutes.

                         SCONES (Baking Powder)

These are richer than biscuit by the addition of cream and eggs. Fine
with a light luncheon. {pg 454}

Sift:

     2 cups cake flour or 1¾ cups bread flour
     3 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 2 teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)
     1 tablespoon sugar
     ½ teaspoon salt

Cut into these ingredients until the butter is the size of a small pea
(use a pastry blender or two knives):

     4 tablespoons butter

Beat in a separate bowl:

     2 eggs

Reserve 2 tablespoons of this. Add to the remainder and beat:

     ⅓ cup cream

Make a well in the dry ingredients. Pour the liquid in it. Combine the
ingredients with a few swift strokes. Handle the dough as little as
possible. Place it on a lightly floured board. Pat it until it is ¾ inch
thick. Cut it with a knife into diamond shapes,[1] brush them with the
reserved egg, sprinkle them with:

       Salt or sugar

Bake them in a hot oven 450° for about 15 minutes.

     3 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 2 teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)

Beat in a separate bowl:

     2 eggs

Combine and add:

     2 tablespoons melted butter
     ¾ cup milk

Stir the liquid quickly into the dry ingredients, taking only 15 to 20
seconds in which to do it. Make no attempt to stir or beat out the
lumps. Ignore them. Unnecessary handling of the batter results in tough
muffins. Pour the batter at once into greased tins or paper baking cups.
Fill them about ⅓ full.[1] Bake the muffins from 15 to 20 minutes in a
hot oven 425°. Remove them at once from the tins. To reheat them, place
them in a paper bag, close the bag and place it in a hot oven 425° for
about 5 minutes.

                                Popovers

Every now and then an excited young woman will rush up to me and say: “I
made popovers by your recipe and _they popped_!” Well, that is what they
are supposed to do, in fact, these are guaranteed to pop. However, the
rise or fall of the popover depends upon:

I. The proper preparation and heat of the pans (preferably iron pans);

II. The proper mixing of the ingredients;

III. The right heat at which to bake them.

                               POPOVERS I

8 to 10 Popovers

Spread popover pans with oil and heat them for 10 minutes in a hot oven
450°.

Sift:

     1 cup bread flour

Add:

     ¼ teaspoon salt

Beat in a separate bowl until frothy:

     2 eggs

Add:

     ⅞ cup milk
     1 tablespoon melted butter

Stir the liquid slowly into the sifted {pg 458}ingredients. Beat the
ingredients until they are well blended, but no longer, then pour the
batter into the oiled and heated pans, filling them only ⅓ full. Bake
the popovers in a hot oven 450° for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat and
dry them in a moderate oven 350° for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove them at
once from the pans. Puncture them to let the steam escape.

Heavy oven-proof glass custard cups may be substituted for iron pans.
Butter them well but do not heat them. Bake them on a cooky sheet.

Prepare the batter given in the preceding rule. Add to it:

     ½ teaspoon salt

Grate into a separate bowl:

     ¼ pound cheese (1 cupful when grated)

Add:

     ⅛ teaspoon paprika
       A few grains cayenne

When the batter and the pans are ready pour one scant tablespoonful in
each cup; cover it with a teaspoonful of cheese and a teaspoonful of

                         Rules for Bread Making

                              YEAST BREADS

Dissolve yeast in lukewarm liquid as directed in the following recipes.
When yeast is dissolved its cells become active. Salt retards its
growth. Sugar furthers it and helps to produce a rich, brown crusty
bread.

The liquid added to bread dough is usually scalded. This is to kill
harmful bacteria that might cause the bread to sour.

_To knead dough_: Press it with the palms of the hands, then fold the
farthest edge to the center. Repeat this motion, turning the dough as
you knead it.

When the ingredients have been combined as directed in these recipes,
place the dough in a warm lightly greased bowl. (You will find that
earthenware and crockery hold heat evenly.) Reverse the dough so that
the greased part will be on top. This will prevent a crust from forming.

Cover the dough with a cloth. Permit it to rise as directed. Place it
where it will be free from draughts. The temperature of the room should
be between seventy-five and eighty-five degrees. Always permit yeast
mixtures to rise slowly. This makes a great difference in texture and
flavor.

When ready to use the dough, shape it into loaves or pinch off portions
with greased hands. Shape it as directed, or place the portions in
greased muffin tins. If it is for rolls and very light, use a spoon.

A second rising for bread is not necessary, but it is usually given
because it improves the texture.

Brush the tops of bread or rolls with soft butter, milk or a beaten egg.
Permit the dough to rise uncovered (this time you want a crust to form).
For the second rising, keep the dough at the same temperature of
seventy-five to eighty-five degrees. If bread rises too quickly it is
apt to be coarse.

When baking, preheat the oven so that it will have the degree of heat
indicated when the bread is put into it.

                         BREADS MADE WITH YEAST

For years I was unfortunate in having what a foreign woman called “a
preconceited idea,” in connection with all recipes calling for yeast.
Someone had given me an exaggerated aspect of the difficulties of
handling it and thus deprived me for a long time of the pleasure of
making and serving the best of all hot breads.

The following methods of bread making are so simple that no one need
hesitate to try them out. {pg 462}

Bread or buns may be made in advance and reheated shortly before they
are served.

                    RULE FOR REHEATING BREAD OR BUNS

Put the bread or buns in a paper bag. Close the bag and place it in a
hot oven 425° for 5 minutes; or put the bread or buns in a hot covered
double boiler over boiling water for about the same length of time. If
the bread is old it may be sprinkled lightly with water.


                             Rolls and Buns

                        BREAD ROLLS (Never fail)

18 two inch rolls

These rolls, incredibly light in texture, are not unlike a Brioche (page
466). They require no kneading.

Dissolve:

     1 yeast cake

in:

     ¼ cup lukewarm water

Place in a separate bowl:

     ¼ cup lard
    1¼ teaspoons salt
     2 tablespoons sugar

Pour over these ingredients and stir until they are dissolved:

     1 cup boiling water

When they are lukewarm add the dissolved yeast. With a wire whisk beat
in:

     1 egg

Stir in:

       Sifted bread flour to make a soft dough (about 2¾ cups)

Place the dough in a large bowl, cover it with a plate and put it in the
icebox. The dough will treble in bulk. Chill it from 2 to 12 hours.
Pinch off small pieces of dough with buttered hands and place them in
greased muffin pans, preferably iron ones, filling the pans about ⅓
full. Cover the tops with:

       Melted butter

Permit the rolls to rise for about 2 hours in a warm place. Bake them in
a hot oven 425° for about 20 minutes. Remove them at once from the pans.
See above rule for Reheating Bread or Buns.

                         FOUR-HOUR BREAD ROLLS

24 two inch rolls

Cream:

     1 tablespoon lard
     1 tablespoon butter
    1½ tablespoons sugar

Add and beat well:

     1 egg or 1 egg white (optional)
     1 cup warm milk

Dissolve:

     1 yeast cake

in:

     ¼ cup lukewarm water

Add these ingredients to the milk mixture. Sift before measuring and
add:

    1½ cups bread flour

Beat the batter well. Cover it with a cloth and permit the dough to rise
in a warm place for 1½ hours. Sift before measuring:

    1½ cups bread flour

Add it to the batter with:

    1¼ teaspoons salt

Beat the batter well. Place the dough in a bowl, cover it with a cloth
and permit it to rise for 1½ hours. Pinch off bits of dough with
buttered hands, shape them into small balls and place them in greased
muffin tins. (The tins should be about ⅓ full). Or place three very
small balls in greased muffin tins to make clover leaf rolls. Brush the
tops with:

       Melted butter

Permit the rolls to rise uncovered in a warm place for 45 minutes. Bake
them in a hot oven 425° for about 20 minutes. Remove them at once from
the pans.

                           “OVERNIGHT” ROLLS

About 44 rolls

Combine:

     1 cake crumbled yeast
     2 teaspoons sugar

Permit these ingredients to stand until they are dissolved and stringy.
Scald:

     1 cup milk

Add and stir until melted:

     7 tablespoons lard

Cool these ingredients. Combine and {pg 463}beat well:

     7 tablespoons sugar
     3 beaten eggs
     1 teaspoon salt

Stir in the milk mixture. Stir in the yeast mixture. Stir in:

    4½ cups sifted bread flour

Beat the dough until it blisters (for about 5 minutes). Place it in a
covered bowl in the refrigerator overnight. Take it out 3½ hours before
baking it. Divide it into three parts. Roll each part into a circle
about 9 inches in diameter. Cut each circle into 16 wedge-shaped
pieces.[1] Roll each piece beginning at the wide end. Stretch the wide
end a little bit as you start to roll it. Brush the rolls with:

     1 egg, beaten

Permit the rolls to rise for 3 hours. Bake them for about 12 minutes on
a greased sheet in a hot oven 450°. Take care. They burn easily.

form a dough that can be handled easily. Place the dough in a bowl.
Brush the top with:

       Melted butter

Cover it and let it rise in a warm place until it doubles in bulk (for
about 2 hours). Roll the dough and cut it into rounds with a floured
biscuit cutter. Dip the handle of a knife in flour and use it to make a
deep crease across the middle of each biscuit. Fold the biscuits over
and press the edges together lightly. Place the biscuits in rows in a
greased pan. Permit them to rise in a warm place until they are light
(for about 35 minutes). Bake them in a hot oven 425° for about 20
minutes. Remove them at once from the pans. See rule for Reheating Bread
or Buns (page 462).

     1 teaspoon grated lemon rind (optional)

Add these ingredients to the milk mixture. Sift before measuring, then
stir in:

    4½ cups bread flour

Beat the dough well. Cover it with a cloth and permit it to rise in a
warm place for 6 hours. Grease muffin tins, fill them ⅓ full with dough.
Brush the tops with:

       Melted butter

Permit the brioche to rise uncovered in a warm place for 30 minutes.
Bake the rolls in a hot oven 425° for about 20 minutes. Remove them at
once from the pans. See rule for Reheating Bread or Buns (page 462).

                               CROISSANTS

About 18 French crescents

Rich, somewhat troublesome, but unequaled by any other form of roll.
{pg 467}

Scald:

     ⅞ cup milk

Stir into it until melted and dissolved:

     1 tablespoon lard
    1½ tablespoons sugar
     ¾ teaspoon salt

Cool these ingredients until they are lukewarm. Add:

     1 cake yeast dissolved in ⅓ cup lukewarm water

Stir in or knead in to make a soft dough about:

    2½ cups sifted bread flour

Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until it is smooth and
elastic. Place the dough in a bowl. Cover it with a cloth. Permit it to
rise until it has doubled in bulk (for about 1½ hours). Cover the dough
with a lid and place it in the refrigerator until it is thoroughly
chilled. Roll out the dough into an oblong ¼ inch thick. Beat until
creamy:

     1 cup butter

Dot the dough with ¼ cup of the butter. Fold the right end over the
center, then fold the left end over the center, so that the dough is in
three layers. Swing the dough around—bring the right end to the bottom,
or as in bridge problems, the East to the South. Roll the dough again to
the thickness of ¼ inch. Dot it with ¼ cup of butter and fold it as
before. Do this twice again, so that you have rolled the dough, dotted
it with butter and folded it and swung it around four times in all.
Cover it and chill it for 2 hours or more. Roll it again on a slightly
floured surface, to the thickness of ¼ inch.

Cut the dough into 3 inch squares. Cut the squares on the bias. Roll the
triangular pieces beginning with the wide side and stretching it
slightly as you roll. Shape the rolls into crescents. Place the
crescents on a tin. Chill them for ½ hour. Bake them for 10 minutes in a
hot oven 450°. Reduce the heat to a moderate oven 350° and bake them
until they are done (for about 10 minutes longer).


                              Icebox Rolls

The following recipes for Icebox Rolls are very good. If preferred, the
dough may be baked in loaves. It is not necessary to knead it at any
time or to touch it with the hands.

                             ICEBOX ROLLS I

18 two and a half inch rolls

Sift before measuring:

    3½ cups bread flour

     1 cup milk

Stir in until dissolved:

     6 tablespoons shortening or butter
     6 tablespoons sugar
    1½ teaspoons salt

Cool to lukewarm. Place in a measuring cup:

     1 cake yeast

Dissolve it in:

     ½ cup lukewarm water

Beat in:

     1 egg

Add these ingredients to the first mixture. Beat in ½ the flour. Beat
the dough for 2 minutes. Add the remaining flour and beat the dough
until it blisters. Place it in a greased bowl. Spread the top lightly
with grease. Cover it closely. Keep it in a refrigerator for at least 24
hours. When it has doubled in bulk, cut through the dough to permit the
gasses to escape. Take out the quantity needed with a spoon or with
buttered hands 4 hours before baking it. Place it in greased muffin
pans, filling the pans ⅓ full. Spread the tops of the rolls with:

       Soft butter

Permit them to rise uncovered in a warm place until doubled in bulk.
Bake them in a quick oven 425° for about 20 minutes. Remove them at once
from the pans. See rule for Reheating Bread or Buns (page 462).

Add:

     1 cup hot water

Pour these ingredients over:

     1 tablespoon lard
     1 tablespoon butter
     2 tablespoons sugar
     2 teaspoons salt

In a separate bowl dissolve:

in:

     ¼ cup warm water

When the first mixture is lukewarm, combine it with the dissolved yeast.
{pg 469}Sift before measuring:

    6½ cups bread flour

Stir in slowly 3 cupfuls of the flour. Beat the batter for 1 minute,
then add the remaining flour. Toss the dough on a floured board. Knead
it well, folding the edges of the dough toward the center and pressing
it down, repeating this motion until it no longer adheres to the board
and is smooth, elastic and full of bubbles. Place the dough in a bowl,
cover it with a cloth. Permit it to rise in a warm place until it has
doubled in bulk (for 1 hour). Cut it down by kneading it to its original
bulk and let it rise again until doubled in bulk (for about 1½ hours).
Shape the dough lightly into loaves, place them in greased tins, filling
the tins only half full. Let the dough rise again until doubled in bulk.
Bake the loaves in a hot oven 450° for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to
350°. Bake the bread until it shrinks from the sides of the pan. It
requires about 40 minutes of baking. Remove it at once from the pans and
place it on a wire cake cooler or in some way that it will have air from
all sides.

                              FRENCH BREAD

Mr. Julian Street who has kindly permitted me to use this rule says, “We
believe the following recipe will make as good a French loaf as it is
possible to make in the ordinary American household range, gas or
electric, with heat coming, not evenly from all sides of the oven, but
only from the bottom. To make up for the lack of the characteristic
brittle crust we slice the loaf diagonally and lightly toast the
slices.”

Scald:

     ½ cup milk

Boil:

     1 cup water

Combine and cool to lukewarm. Break:

     1 cake yeast

into:

     ¼ cup lukewarm water

Add it to the above mixture with:

    1½ tablespoons shortening
     1 tablespoon sugar

Measure into a large mixing bowl:

     4 cups enriched white flour
     2 teaspoons salt
     ½ tablespoon sugar

Make a hole in the center. Pour in the liquid mixture. Stir thoroughly
but _do not knead_. The dough will be soft. Cover with wax paper or a
damp cloth and set in warm place to rise, allowing about 2 hours for
rising. Break down the dough. Place on lightly floured board and cut
into 2 equal parts. Form each into a French loaf by folding the top over
to form symmetrical roll. Continue rolling, pressing outward with the
hands until a long, thin roll is achieved. Place the two loaves on a
buttered cooky sheet, cut diagonal slits across top with sharp-pointed
scissors to form customary indentations. Set in warm place to rise to
somewhat more than double in bulk. Preheat oven to 400°. On bottom of
oven place pie tin filled with boiling water. Bake 15 minutes at 400°;
30 minutes at 350°. Five minutes before bread is finished brush loaves
with a glazing mixture of:

     1 beaten egg white
     1 tablespoon cold water.

             TO TEST THE HEAT OF FAT WITHOUT A THERMOMETER

Heat the fat slowly. Drop a one inch cube of bread (one day old) into
it. If the bread browns in 40 seconds the fat is ready for frying cooked
food. If the bread browns in one minute the fat is ready for frying
uncooked food. The exception to this rule is French Fried Potatoes. Fry
these when a cube of bread browns in 20 seconds.


                        RULE FOR DEEP FAT FRYING

Choose a deep heavy saucepan with straight sides. This will answer well
for occasional frying. If a great deal of frying is done, an iron kettle
and a wire basket (with a handle) that fits into it will be found a
great convenience. In addition, provide yourself with a long-handled
skimmer or a slotted spoon and a long-handled fork. The fat or oil
should be deep enough to cover the food generously (about 4 inches
deep). Two or three inches must be allowed between the fat and the top
of the pan to keep the fat from bubbling over.

Heat the fat or oil slowly to the desired temperature. See the preceding
Chart for Deep Fat Frying.

Fry only a small quantity of food at a time, otherwise you will reduce
the temperature of the fat too much. Have the food to be fried at room
temperature for the same reason. If it has been chilled, remove it from
the refrigerator about an hour before frying.

To a three quart size kettle filled with one quart of fat or oil allow
about three doughnuts, three croquettes or one cupful of potatoes at a
time.

Lower the basket slowly into the fat. The bubbling will soon subside. If
a frying basket is not available place the food on a long-handled spoon
and lower it slowly into the fat. When it is cooked on one side turn it
and cook the other. Do not let the food touch while frying. Separate it
with a fork or skimmer. As soon as the food is well browned remove it
from the fat and drain it on absorbent paper—paper towels, napkins or
unglazed paper. Retest the temperature frequently. Skim off all food
scraps to prevent smoke.

After frying the food, cool the fat, strain it through cheesecloth,
paper towels or a fine sieve and place it in a covered receptacle in the
refrigerator. The same fat may be used repeatedly. Fish, croquettes,
onions and doughnuts may all be fried in the same fat without
transmitting the flavor of one food to another.

If the fat becomes dark it may be clarified by adding a raw, peeled and
sliced potato. Heat the fat slowly until the potato browns, then strain
the fat.

Keep fat in the refrigerator and oil in a cool place. {pg 478}

                              BREADED FOOD

Roll until very fine:

       Cracker crumbs, bread crumbs, cornflakes or bran

The crumbs may be sifted and seasoned. Combine and beat lightly:

     1 egg
     2 tablespoons water

Roll the food to be breaded in the crumbs, dip them in the egg mixture
and roll them again in the crumbs. To avoid sticky hands, bread with one
hand and dip with the other. If this is done ½ hour before the food is
fried, the crumbs will have a better chance to adhere. It is important
to cover the entire surface of the food well with the egg mixture. When
placed in the hot fat the egg at once forms a coating which the fat
cannot penetrate.

                               Doughnuts

                       RULE FOR FRYING DOUGHNUTS

When frying doughnuts have a wide saucepan of boiling water in
readiness. Lift each doughnut, as soon as it is fried, rapidly in and
out of the boiling water. Place the doughnuts in a moderate oven 375°
until they are dry and crisp. Sprinkle them with confectioner’s sugar[1]
or ice them, when cold, with cake icing.

Be careful to wipe the water from the utensil used in handling the
doughnuts before putting it again in the hot fat.

When the water in the saucepan is cold a cake of fat will gather on it.
This may be removed and used again.

To make this delicious confection follow the recipe on page 577 for:

       Cream Puffs

You may add:

     ½ teaspoon grated orange or lemon rind
     1 tablespoon sugar

Permit this to cool for 5 minutes. Use a pastry tube to make circles or
figure eight doughnuts on squares of heavily greased paper, or on the
end of a well-greased pancake turner. Turn the paper upside-down to drop
the doughnuts into hot fat. Fry by the rule for Doughnuts on page 479.
When cold these doughnuts are sometimes iced with confectioner’s sugar
diluted with lemon juice.

                                ROSETTES

Rosettes are shaped with a small iron made for the purpose. They are
very good served with creamed food, sweet sauce, stewed fruit, etc.

Beat until blended:

       2 eggs

Add and beat:

     1 teaspoon sugar[1]
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Sift before measuring:

     1 cup bread flour

Stir it into the egg mixture alternately with:

     1 cup milk

Rosettes are fried in deep fat heated to 370° (hot enough to brown a
cube of bread in 1 minute). Heat the iron by immersing it in the fat
until it is entirely covered, dip it in the batter, but do not let the
batter run over the top of the iron. Return the iron to the fat,
immersing it completely from 20 to 35 seconds. Remove the rosette from
the iron with a fork. Reheat the iron in the hot fat and repeat the
process. Drain the rosettes on absorbent paper and serve them sprinkled
with:

       Confectioner’s sugar

                         TIMBALE CASES for FOOD

Select a timbale iron that is fluted, as it is easier to handle than a
plain one.

Sift:

     ¾ cup flour
     ½ teaspoon salt

Combine and beat:

     1 egg
     ½ cup milk

Combine the liquid and the sifted ingredients with a few swift strokes.

Add:

     1 teaspoon olive oil or melted butter

Heat deep fat to 350° (page 477—when it will brown a cube of dry bread
in 70 seconds). Heat the timbale iron for 15 minutes in the hot fat.
Wipe it with a cloth wrapped around a fork. Plunge the iron into the
batter, within ¾ inch of the top. Remove it. Allow the batter to dry on
the iron. Flatten bubbles that may appear with the fingers. Fry the
timbale in the hot fat. Remove it from the iron and drain it on a paper
towel. Repeat the process. {pg 482}


                             Griddle Cakes

                     RULE FOR BAKING GRIDDLE CAKES

Prepare griddle cake batter by one of the following rules. Meanwhile
heat an iron griddle. It may be greased with a bit of bacon or a turnip
cut in two but this is usually unnecessary. However, if a griddle has
once been greased the process will probably have to be repeated. If this
is the case, wipe the griddle with an oiled cloth between “bakings.”

Test the griddle by throwing a few drops of cold water upon it. If the
water sputters a good deal the griddle is ready for the cakes.

Drop the batter by the spoonfuls on the griddle. The cakes are ready for
their first turning after they have been baked from two to three
minutes. When bubbles appear on their surface and begin to burst, lift
the cakes with a spatula to see that the under surface is well browned,
then turn them and continue baking them until the other side is browned.
If the griddle has been greased, wipe it with an oiled cloth before
baking more cakes on it. (Watch your fingers!)

Serve the cakes as soon as possible. If they cannot be served at once
keep them in a warm place in stacks of not more than four.

              GRIDDLE CAKES or BATTER CAKES I (Sweet Milk)

Sift before measuring:

    1½ cups bread flour

Resift with:

     1 teaspoon salt
    2½ teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder, or 1¼ teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)

Beat lightly:

     2 eggs[1]

Add:

     1 tablespoon melted butter
    1¼ cups milk

Make a hole in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the liquid
ingredients. Stir them with a few swift strokes until they are blended
only. Ignore the lumps; they are harmless. This process should take only
20 seconds. The batter may be prepared ahead of time if covered at once
and placed in the refrigerator. It may be kept overnight or longer and
give excellent results. Follow the preceding rule for baking the cakes.

                            CRÊPES SUZETTE I

At the age of fourteen, the famous Franco-American cook, Henri
Charpentier, invented crêpes Suzette—a glorified French pancake. His
patron was Albert, Prince of Wales, whose penchant for all that was
bright and gay seemed a defense against his incredibly dull upbringing.
Henri tells in his amusing reminiscences (_Life à la Henri_, Simon and
Shuster) of his delight in tempting the rather jaded palate of the
famous gourmet.

One day he was composing a crêpe sauce—a most complicated affair—a
blend of orange and lemon peel, sugar, butter, maraschino, curaçao and
kirsch. By accident the cordials caught fire and the poor boy thought
that both he and his sauce were ruined. The Prince was waiting, how
could Henri begin all over again? He tasted the sauce—it was delicious.
Quickly he plunged the crêpes into the boiling liquid, added more of the
cordials and let the sauce burn again. The dish was a triumph.

Asked by the Prince what he called these fabulous cakes, Henri
stammered, “Crêpes Princesse.” The Prince, acknowledging the compliment
to himself, answered gallantly that there was a lady present. There was,
a very small girl—would Henri consent to changing the name to Crêpes
Suzette? Henri would and did. Later he received from the Prince a
jeweled ring, a hat and a cane, but best of all he had put his foot on
the first rung of the ladder to his future success.

This is Henri’s recipe, condensed and put into what approximates
American form. It makes eight cakes—“enough for four people,” says
Henri.

Combine and stir until the ingredients are the consistency of thin
cream:

     3 eggs
     2 tablespoons flour
     1 tablespoon water
     1 tablespoon milk
       A pinch of salt

Place in a small skillet:

       Butter “as one joint of your thumb”

When this bubbles pour in enough paste to cover the bottom of the pan
with a thin coating—“almost like the white of an egg.” Keep the pan
moving, for this is a delicate substance. A minute of cooking and the
job is ¾ done. Turn the cake. Now again and again and again until the
cake is well browned. Now fold the cake twice. It will be triangular in
shape “like a lady’s handkerchief.”

Prepare:

Henri’s Butter Sauce for Crêpes Suzette

This may be made in advance and kept for months in a cool place.

Cut into very thin strips pieces of:

       Lemon rind ¾ inch square
       Orange rind ¾ inch square

“Enough to put a patch on the ball of your thumb.” Use only the thin
yellow rind. Add:

     1 teaspoon vanilla sugar[1]

Permit these ingredients to stand closely covered for 12 hours or more.
Melt in a large thin skillet (Henri says a silver skillet):

     ½ cup sweet butter

When it starts to bubble add:

     1 pony maraschino
     1 pony curaçao
     1 pony kirsch

Put a lighted match to the sauce. As the flame dies down add the lemon
and orange mixture. (Place the sauce in a cool place until ready for
use, if you wish.) Make the crêpes. Plunge the cakes in boiling sauce.
Turn them. Add:

     1 pony maraschino
     1 pony curaçao
     1 pony kirsch

Put a lighted match to the sauce. Permit it to burn. Serve the cakes at
once. The final performance—plunging the folded crêpes into the boiling
sauce, adding and burning the liquor {pg 486}is done in the presence of
the one to be feted.

-----

[1] Vanilla sugar is made by placing a vanilla bean in a quart jar of
granulated sugar long enough to flavor it well. A few drops of vanilla
and 1 teaspoonful of sugar may be substituted (say I—not Henri).

Having given the original version of this famous dish, I shall follow it
by a less complicated and very good, if not authentic, recipe.

                           CRÊPES SUZETTE II

There are now endless ways of preparing crêpes Suzette. The rule for
French Pancakes will answer as well as any for everyday use. Needless to
say, but being said for the benefit of those who need an introduction,
these cakes are about as good to eat as anything man or superman can
make.

Follow the rule for:

       French Pancakes (page 484)

Substitute for the lemon and vanilla:

     1 teaspoon cognac or curaçao (optional)

Bake the cakes as directed. Spread them at once with the following
sauce. Stir until blended and creamy:

     ½ cup butter
     1 cup confectioner’s sugar

Add:

     5 tablespoons orange juice
     1 tablespoon lemon juice
     2 teaspoons grated orange rind or orange marmalade[1]

Roll the cakes and sprinkle them with:

       Confectioner’s sugar

Place them in a fairly hot oven 400° to melt the sugar. Put the crêpes
on a hot platter. Have it brought to the table. Cover the bottom of the
platter to the depth of ¼ inch with:

     2 parts brandy
     1 part wine

Put a lighted match to the liquor. Permit it to burn down. Serve the
crêpes at once.

-----

[1] Tangerine juice and rind may be substituted for the orange and
marmalade or the crêpes may be spread with any good Hard Sauce (page
670) and served with or without the addition of the brandy and wine.
Here is a simple rule.

Heat and stir in a double boiler until smooth:

     1 teaspoon grated orange rind
     ½ cup orange juice
     3 tablespoons butter
    1½ cups confectioner’s sugar

Add:

       Rum, sherry or dessert wine (optional)

A good way to serve the crêpes is to spread them generously with jelly,
roll them and cover them with whipped cream dotted with jelly. Place
them in a hot oven 400° until the cream and the jelly are melted.
Raspberry jam flavored with rum makes a good filling. So does bar le duc
jelly.

     ½ cake (ounce) yeast in 2 cups lukewarm milk

Stir in until well blended:

    1½ cups sifted bread flour
     2 tablespoons sugar

Set this sponge to rise in a warm place for 1½ hours. Cover the bowl
with a cloth. Beat until well blended:

     3 egg yolks
     6 tablespoons soft butter

Stir in:

    1½ cups sifted bread flour
     ¾ teaspoon salt

Beat these ingredients into the sponge. Permit the sponge to rise again
for 1½ hours. Whip until stiff:

     3 egg whites

Fold them into the batter. After 10 minutes bake the batter, a very
small quantity at a time, in a 5 inch skillet spread with butter. As
they bake spread the unbaked side of the cakes with:

       Soft butter

The blini should be paper thin. Serve them with:

                   AUSTRIAN PANCAKE or OMELET SOUFFLÉ

4 small servings—if you are not very hungry

Known in Salzburg as a “Nockerl.” Few visitors failed to indulge in one
or more between the delights of the Annual Musical Festival, and it is
safe to suppose that the inhabitants indulge in them the year around.
This rich omelet soufflé or pancake is good as a breakfast or supper
dish and wonderful as a dessert with rum or fruit sauce.

Make it immediately before it is to be {pg 487}served. It has very
little body and shrinks quickly.

Melt in a 9 or 10 inch skillet:

     1 tablespoon butter

The skillet should be hot when the soufflé mixture is put into it. Beat
until very light:

     4 egg yolks
     2 to 4 tablespoons sugar

Add:

     ⅛ to ¼ teaspoon vanilla

Whip until stiff:

     4 egg whites
       A pinch of salt

Fold the yolk mixture lightly into the egg whites. Heap the soufflé into
the hot skillet by the spoonful. Allow about 5 minutes in all for
cooking it. Brown the underside, turn the puffs and brown the other
side. The center should remain soft. If you are serving the nockerl
without fruit or sauce, sprinkle it with:

       Confectioner’s sugar

                                Waffles

                        RULE FOR MAKING WAFFLES

Heat a waffle iron. To test the heat of the iron (if there is no
indicator) throw a drop of water upon it. If the water boils and forms a
small ball the iron is ready for use. If it sizzles vigorously it is too
hot.

Have the batter ready. Place it in a medium-sized pitcher. It takes from
four to five minutes to bake the average waffle—a little longer for a
thin batter.

The majority of waffle recipes call for cake flour. If that is not
{pg 489}available substitute bread flour, deducting two tablespoonfuls
from every cupful given in the recipe.

The majority of recipes call for the separate beating of the egg whites.
I am following this rule but I find that good waffles may be made
without this additional effort.

Waffles are fine as a main dish with creamed chicken, fish or left-over
food or as a dessert with ice cream, crushed or stewed fruit, sirup,
etc.

Waffle batter may be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days if kept
in a covered container. When ready to bake do not stir batter any more
than necessary.

See Waffles with Homemade Biscuit Mix, page 490. Use this as a basis for
other waffles given in this chapter—raisin, pecan, etc.

     2 to 7 tablespoons melted butter[1]
    1½ cups milk

Make a hole in the center of the sifted ingredients. Pour in the liquid
ingredients. Combine them with a few swift strokes. The batter should
have a pebbled look similar to a muffin batter.

Beat until stiff, but not dry:

     3 egg whites

Fold them into the batter until they are barely blended. Bake the

at high speed until they stand up in peaks. Combine the remaining
ingredients. Beat them at medium speed for 2 minutes. Fold in the egg
whites at low speed, for not more than ½ minute.

should be at the temperature given in these recipes when the food to be
baked is placed in it.

                                PIE PANS

If a pie is to have a deep filling (and to me this is the ideal pie) a
deep pie pan will be a great help. I have tried to indicate accurately
in each recipe how large a shell is required for each filling, but the
matter is, of course, one of individual preference.


                       RULE FOR MAKING PIE CRUST

              1 two crust or 2 single crust nine inch pies

All the materials used should be as cold as possible. The water should
be iced.

Pie dough should be handled lightly and as little as possible.

Measure: {pg 494}

    1¾ cups cake flour or
    1½ cups bread flour

Resift with:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     1 teaspoon any baking powder

Measure:

     4 tablespoons lard[1]
     2 tablespoons butter

Divide the shortening into two parts. Cut half of the shortening into
the flour mixture with two knives or a pastry blender until it looks
like corn meal. Cut in the remaining shortening coarsely until it is the
size of a large pea.

Have ready:

     ¼ cup ice water

Sprinkle 3 tablespoonfuls over the mixture. Blend it in lightly. If the
dough will hold together so that it may be gathered up in a ball stop
handling it. If not, use additional water. A good rule for making pastry
is: “Keep the moisture out and the air in.” Add the last of the water
where the ingredients are driest. Some cooks make fine pie crust with a
fork, lifting the ingredients to permit the moisture to spread. Others
use a spoon deftly, or touch the dough very lightly with the fingertips.
If feasible chill it for 12 hours, if not, chill it for 10 minutes.

As soon as the dough will hold together, stop handling it. Divide it
into two parts, one slightly larger than the other. Keep the smaller
part for the top crust. If the room is hot place this part where it will
be cold. Roll out the larger part for the bottom crust to the thickness
of ⅛ inch, using as little flour as possible on the board and on the
roller (or roll the dough between sheets of waxed paper.)[2] Roll the
dough in one direction only. Lift the roller, do not push it to and fro.
Do not stretch the dough. Cut it 1 inch larger than the pan to allow for
shrinkage.

To lift the pastry from the board, fold it in half, lay the fold across
the center of the pan and unfold it, or roll it around the rolling pin,
unroll it onto the pan. Prick it with a fork in several places. Do not
grease the pan—good pastry makes this unnecessary.

For a one crust pie make a fluted edge with the dough that laps over or
build up a rim with a strip of pastry. Full it on. Use a fork to press
it down, or pinch it with the thumb and forefinger. This edge is
important as it will help to hold the juices in the pie. If the pie is
to be filled with a juicy filling, brush the bottom crust lightly with
the white of an egg or with melted butter to keep it from being soggy.
Fill the pie and moisten the edges with a little water.

Roll the dough for the top crust, cut it 1 inch larger than the pan and
prick it with a fork in several places (or fold it over and gash it with
a knife) to allow the steam to escape. Place the top crust on the pie.
Full in the surplus dough and press it down around the edges with a fork
or tuck it under the lower crust and press it around the edge with a
fork, or cut the lower crust ½ inch larger than the upper crust and fold
it over like a hem.

The top may be brushed with milk or with 1 egg diluted with 1
tablespoonful of water. This will make it glossy.

If the pie is filled with juicy fruit or custard, wring a strip of
cotton {pg 495}1 inch wide out of cold water and fasten it around the
edge or use a piece of parchment tape. This will keep the juices from
boiling out. So will two pieces of macaroni—about three inches
long—placed in the pie through a puncture in the upper crust.

If a lattice of pastry is desired, cut long narrow strips of dough with
a knife, or a pie jagger (the latter makes a pinked edge). Place the
strips across the top of the pie and moisten them slightly with water
where they meet the edge of the pie.

To bake the pie consult the preceding Temperature Chart.

If a shell or a pie crust is desired bake it on the bottom of a pie pan,
that is, invert the pan and fit the dough over the bottom. Prick it with
a fork and press it down lightly around the edge. Cut a round for the
top crust, prick it and bake it on a baking sheet. When making
individual pies, use an inverted muffin tin. Cut rounds of dough 4½ or
5½ inches in diameter and fit them over the cups. Prick them before
baking them. Bake large or individual pie shells for 12 minutes in a
very hot oven 500°.

Pie dough may be made in advance, wrapped in wax paper and placed in a
refrigerator. It will keep for days. Chilled dough will roll more
readily than fresh dough.

[1] If you find this measurement scant (it makes excellent pie crust)
increase the shortening to ½ cupful in all—or follow the fine rule on
page 497, for Rough or Half-Puff Paste—treating the ingredients as
suggested in this rule for Pie Crust.

[2] You may purchase a heavy cloth and a cloth covered rolling pin that
practically eliminate the sticking of the dough.

HINTS for PIE MAKING

    I. Too much flour makes pie crust tough.
   II. Too much shortening makes it dry and crumbly.
  III. Too much liquid makes it heavy and soggy.

                    PIE CRUST MADE with FLOUR PASTE

A new method joyously acclaimed by many.

Sift, then measure:

     2 cups bread flour

Resift it into a bowl with:

     1 teaspoon salt

Measure ⅓ cupful of this mixture and place it in a small bowl or cup.
Stir into it to form a smooth paste:

     ¼ cup water

Cut into the flour mixture in the first bowl until it is the size of a
small pea:

     ⅔ cup shortening

To do this use two knives or a pastry blender. Stir the flour paste into
the dough. Work it with your hand until it is well incorporated and the
dough may be gathered into a ball. Treat the dough as you would any pie
crust. It may be chilled before it is rolled. Roll it by the preceding
rule for Pie Crust.

                          HOT WATER PIE CRUST

1 two crust pie

This recipe is an amazingly quick way of making pie crust—almost like
magic. The process is so simple that it is absolutely fool-proof. The
dough will keep for a week in a cold place. Age improves it.

Place in a bowl:

     ½ cup lard

Pour over it:

     ¼ cup boiling water

Beat these ingredients until they are cold and creamy. If there is time,
chill them. Sift before measuring:

    1½ cups cake flour

Resift with:

     ½ teaspoon any baking powder
     ½ teaspoon salt

Combine the liquid and the sifted ingredients and stir them until they
form a smooth ball. Cover the dough and chill it until it is firm. Roll
it by the rule for Pie Crust (page 493). Bake it by the chart for Baking
Pies (page 493). {pg 496}

     6 tablespoons butter

Beat, then work in with the fingers:

     1 egg yolk
     1 tablespoon water
    1½ tablespoons lemon juice

Chill these ingredients thoroughly. Roll them or pat them until the
dough is ⅛ inch thick. Place it in the bottom of a 9 x 12 inch pan.
Chill the dough thoroughly. Cover it with about:

     3 cups sugared fruit

Bake the galette in a hot oven 425° for about 25 minutes.

Rule II.

A similar result may be obtained with a paste made of:

     1 cup bread flour

are many forms of Fruit Kuchen: one being a raised Coffee Cake Dough
(pages 551, 553); and a more cakelike dough—Dutch Apple, Peach or Plum
Cake (page 559).

                   CREAM CHEESE PASTRY (Vienna Tarts)

Delicious for turnovers or with the soup or salad course.

Sift before measuring:

     1 cup bread flour

Resift with:

     ¼ teaspoon salt (optional)

Cut into these ingredients with a pastry blender or 2 knives:

     ½ cup butter
    1½ (3 oz.) packages soft cream cheese or dry cottage cheese

When the ingredients are well blended wrap the dough in waxed paper.
Place it on ice for 12 hours. Roll it on a piece of waxed paper to the
thickness of ⅛ inch. For the soup or salad course cut the dough into
rounds. Bake them on an ungreased tin in a hot oven 450° for about 12
minutes. Serve them hot.

For Turnovers

Cut the dough into squares. Place on each square:

       A dab of jelly, preserves, stewed drained fruit, puréed prunes,
       etc.

Gather up the corners and pinch them together. Bake the turnovers in a
hot oven 450° for about 15 minutes. Serve them hot sprinkled with:

       Confectioner’s sugar

                        ROUGH or HALF-PUFF PASTE

1 nine inch pie crust or top

A simple substitute for the more troublesome Puff Paste of the following
rule. Fine as a top crust for a creamed dish.

Sift before measuring:

     2 cups bread flour

Resift with:

     ½ teaspoon salt

Cut into pieces about 1 inch in size:

     6 tablespoons unsalted butter
     6 tablespoons lard

Combine:

     ½ teaspoon lemon juice
     6 tablespoons ice water

Mix the shortening lightly with the flour mixture. Make a well in the
center. Add a little of the water. Mix lightly, keeping the shortening
intact. Add enough of the rest of the liquid to form a moderately stiff
dough. Roll the dough into a long oblong. Fold it equally in three. Turn
it so that you have the folded edges to the right and left. Roll it out
again. Repeat this process until the dough has been rolled 4 times. It
may be kept in a cool place for 1 hour but should rest for at least ½
hour. Treat it as you would any pie crust but moisten the edge of the
pie pan in order to have it stick to the rim. This dough may be used for
rolls, vol au vent, hors d’œuvre, etc.—excellent with sausage meat
filling. It is improved by using a glaze made of:

     1 egg diluted with
     1 tablespoon water

Brush it with this when half cooked.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                               PUFF PASTE

Before beginning the adventure with puff paste there is one thing to be
explained that will make its composition comparatively easy. The butter
used must be washed. The purpose of washing it is to make it elastic. It
should be soft through being kneaded, but in no sense soft through being
melted—quite the contrary, it must be soft and cold at the same time.
In winter turn on the cold water faucet. Manipulate the butter with the
hands under the stream of cold water until it is creamy and waxy. At
other seasons, do this in a quart of ice water placed in a bowl. (The
butter may be kneaded with a spoon if preferred.) The final kneading of
the butter is done on a board or it is patted briskly in the hands until
no water flies.

This is the recipe of a professional cook. As it calls for egg yolks it
differs from the orthodox rule for {pg 498}Puff Paste. However, her
results are remarkable and her method is simple, so I am giving it in
preference to the usual rather complicated recipes. She stresses two
points: Keep the hands, the bowl, the board and the rolling pin as cold
as possible. A cold windy day is best for making puff paste.

Work with the hands (see the first paragraph):

     1 cup butter

Place part of the butter (¼ cupful) in a cold bowl. Form the remainder
into a square and place it where it will keep cold. Add to the butter in
the bowl:

     2 cups sifted bread flour
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Work these ingredients with a pastry blender, two knives or the
fingertips. Beat and add:

     ¼ cup ice water
     2 egg yolks[1]

Work these ingredients well with the hand. If necessary add (to loosen
the dough from the bowl):

       A pinch of flour

Place the dough where it will be cold but will not freeze, preferably in
the open air.[2] After fifteen minutes roll the dough into a square on a
floured board. Roll it one way only, not back and forth. A good way is
out from the center.

Put the square of butter in the center of the dough and fold the four
corners to the center completely covering the butter. Permit the dough
to stand on a cloth or piece of waxed paper in a cold place for ½ hour.
Turn it once to keep it from becoming dry. Roll out the dough again into
a square and fold the corners to the center. Permit it to stand again
for ½ hour. Repeat this process. The dough must be chilled and rolled at
least four times in all.

Chill the dough until you are ready to use it. Wrapped in waxed paper it
may be kept in a refrigerator for several days. Roll it, cut it into
shapes. Chill it again and bake it. One of the success secrets of puff
paste is to have it ice cold when placed in a hot oven.

The matter of baking puff paste is a moot point. In all rules the very
cold paste is put into a very hot oven—500°. In some it is baked at
this temperature throughout[3]; in others the heat is reduced 50° every
five minutes until the temperature is 350° for the final baking.

-----

[1] The egg yolks may be omitted. In that case use in all 6 tablespoons
of water.

[2] If it is not possible to do this, fold the dough in a clean cloth
and place it in a dripping pan that has been placed between two dripping
pans filled with ice. Do not let the dough come in direct contact with
the ice.

[3] In this case the pastry is covered with waxed paper after ten
minutes’ baking.

                              PATTY SHELLS

Prepare by the preceding rule:

       Puff Paste

Roll the paste ¼ inch thick. Cut as many rounds with a 3 inch cutter as
you wish to have patties. Cut twice as many additional rounds and cut
the centers from them with a smaller cutter, making rings. Place two
rings on each round. Press them lightly together. Place the shells on
two layers of heavy brown paper placed on a sheet or in a pan. Chill
them. Bake the shells in a hot oven 500° for 5 minutes. Bake them with a
decreasing heat (see last paragraph of the preceding rule) for about 20
minutes.

Serve the shells hot,[1] filled with:

       Creamed food

                               NAPOLEONS

Prepare:

       Puff Paste (page 497)

Roll the paste ¼ inch thick. Cut it into 2 x 4 inch strips. Prick them
with a fork. Place them on two layers of heavy brown paper on a sheet or
in a pan. Chill them. Bake them in a hot oven 500° for 5 minutes. Reduce
the heat (see the last paragraph of the rule for Puff Paste) and bake
them for about 10 minutes longer. Cool the cakes. Split them lengthwise
into halves. Fill them with:

       Custard Filling (page 623)

Serve them with:

       Fluffy Strawberry Sauce (page 676)


                              Crumb Crusts

These crusts are a fine short cut to pie making. They are rapidly
{pg 499}growing in popularity, as they are very good and very easy to
make.

                    GRAHAM CRACKER or ZWEIBACK CRUST

1 nine inch pie

Crush or grind until very fine:

    1½ cups graham crackers or Zwieback crumbs[1]

Stir into them:

     ¼ cup confectioner’s sugar[2]
     6 tablespoons melted butter
     1 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)

Reserve ½ cupful of this mixture. Place the remainder in a deep 9 inch
pie pan. Pat it firmly with the palm of the hand, or with a spoon
against the bottom and sides of the pan to form a pie shell. Chill the
crust thoroughly (it may be prepared long in advance). It is not
necessary to bake it before it is filled. If well chilled it may be
baked at the same time as the meringue. If you wish to use the crust at
once, bake it without chilling it in a moderate oven 375° for 15
minutes.

After being chilled, or baked, fill the crust with any previously
cooked:

       Custard filling, cream filling or Fresh or dried fruit filling

Cover it with a:

       Meringue (page 510)

Sprinkle the reserved crumbs over the top. Bake the pie in a slow oven
300° for 15 minutes.

A previously baked crumb crust is good filled with:

       Gelatine Chiffon Pie Filling (page 519)
       Sweetened fresh or stewed fruit

Top it with:

       Whipped cream

-----

[1] This recipe is sufficient for a bottom crust and a generous
sprinkling of crumbs on top of 1 nine inch pie. One cup of crumbs will
suffice for the bottom of 1 seven inch pie and a light sprinkling for
the top.

[2] Sugar in crumb crusts is a matter of taste. The amount used is best
determined by the type of filling to be used.

     6 tablespoons unblanched almonds, ground
     6 tablespoons sugar
     ¼ cup top milk or light cream
     ½ cup melted butter
     ⅓ teaspoon cinnamon (optional)

     ¼ teaspoon cinnamon (optional)

Press the crust firmly on the bottom and sides of the pan. Chill the
crust. To bake it or to fill and bake it follow the rule for Graham
Cracker Crust (on this page). This will make a 7 inch pie shell. Use ½
again as much if you want a 9 inch shell and crumbs for the top.

                        Pies Baked with Fillings

The Emperor Claudius refers in 46 A.D. to an apple pie made with
{pg 500}honey and spices, but in America, up to the time of the
Revolution, pies were customarily made of beefsteaks or kidneys; fruit
pies were a later development and seem to have originated through grim
necessity at a time when Washington’s larder was sorely tried to keep up
with the old custom.

In a letter written in 1779, Washington warns two ladies whom he has
invited to dine with him about what they will be given to eat. He
writes:

    “When the cook has a mind to cut a figure (which I presume will
    be the case tomorrow), we have two beef-steak pyes, or dishes of
    crabs in addition, one on each side of the center dish, dividing
    the space & reducing the distance between dish & dish to about
    six feet, which without them would be near 12 feet apart. Of
    late he has had the surprising sagacity to discover that apples
    will make pyes; and its a question, if, in the violence of his
    efforts, we do not get one of apples, instead of having both of
    beef-steaks. . .”

Praise be to the nameless cook! A friend of mine is so fond of apple pie
that he says his coat of arms bears an apple pie rampant. Every attempt
has been made to make this one couchant.

                       RULE for SPONGE CAKE PIES

These recipes are hard to classify, as the fillings may be cooked in
unbaked pie shells or in baked pie shells. Having tried both ways and
found them equally good, the matter seems to be largely one of
convenience.

Line a pie pan with:

       Pie Crust (page 493)

It may be baked in a very hot oven 500° for 10 minutes, or it may be
used without being baked. If it has been baked fill it with one of the
following fillings and bake it in a moderate oven 375° for about 30
minutes, or until the top is brown. If it is unbaked, fill it with one
of the following fillings and bake it in a hot oven 450° for 15 minutes.
Reduce the heat and finish baking it in a moderate oven 350° for 30
minutes longer or until it is firm.

            Meringue Pies and Fillings for Baked Pie Shells

                           RULE for MERINGUE

A meringue is beaten constantly until it is spread. Its success depends
upon the proper beating of the egg whites, the slow addition of the
sugar and the slow oven in which it is baked. Beat the egg whites on a
platter or in a large bowl. Use a flat wire whisk.

Add:

     2 teaspoons water (optional)
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

to:

     2 egg whites

Whip them until they are frothy. Add:

     ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar

Whip them until they are stiff, but not dry. Beat in ½ teaspoonful at a
time:

     4 tablespoons granulated or confectioner’s sugar

Beat in:

     ½ teaspoon vanilla

Some of the rules call for meringues made with:

     3 egg whites
     1 tablespoon water

In that case use:

     ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
     6 tablespoons sugar
     ¾ teaspoon vanilla

After the ingredients are combined continue beating the meringue for
several minutes (until it holds its shape well). Pile it lightly on a
filled pie shell; spread it lightly with a spatula. Bake it in a slow
oven 300° for 15 to 20 minutes. Permit it to cool slowly.

                 *        *        *        *        *

            RULE for MAKING MERINGUE with an ELECTRIC MIXER

Use the ingredients given in the preceding rule. Beat egg whites, cream
of tartar and water in the small bowl at high speed for 3 minutes. Add
sugar gradually, 1 tablespoonful at a time. Add salt and flavoring.
Continue beating at high speed until mixture will stand in peaks, 4 to 5
minutes. Bake it by the preceding rule. {pg 511}

                            CRUMB CRUST PIES

Do not neglect these unusually tempting desserts—Custard, Butterscotch,
Banana, Cocoanut, Chocolate and other meringue pies made with crumb
crusts. These are best made with a previously baked Crumb Pie Shell (see
page 499). Sprinkle the reserved crumbs over the meringue before baking
it.

                              APPLE PIE II

1 seven inch pie

Prepare:

       A baked Pie Shell (page 493)

Peel, core and slice:

     5 medium-sized apples

Make a sirup of:

     ½ cup sugar[1]
     ¼ cup water

Add:

     1 tablespoon butter

Add the apples. Stir them gently, cover them and cook them until they
are nearly tender. Stir them from time to time so that they do not burn.
If the apples are not tart add:

     1 teaspoon or more lemon juice
     1 teaspoon grated lemon rind

Pour off a little of the juice, cool, then stir into it:[2]

     ¼ teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
     ⅛ teaspoon nutmeg (optional)
     ½ tablespoon cornstarch

Pour this over the apples. Cook and stir them until they boil. Pour the
apples into the pie shell. Cover them with a Meringue (page 510) made
with:

     2 egg whites (optional)

Bake the meringue in a slow oven 300° for 15 to 20 minutes; or cover the
top with crumb crust. Brown the top crust under a broiler.

-----

[1] Very tart apples may require additional sugar. Brown sugar may be
substituted for granulated sugar.

[2] Instead of following these instructions vary your fruit pie fillings
in the following way:

Cook the fruit with the sugar and water until it is tender. Omit the
butter. Add the lemon juice and rind. Cool the fruit slightly. Beat in 2
egg yolks. Stir and cook the fruit over hot water until the yolks
thicken. Fill the pie shell and proceed with the meringue.

                              PEACH PIE II

Follow the preceding rule for Apple Pie II. If the peaches are very
sweet use less sugar.

they will not scorch. Add to them:

     ⅔ to 1 cup sugar, according to the acidity of the fruit[2]

Cook them over a low fire until they are soft. Stir them from the bottom
to prevent them from burning. Pour off a little of the juice. Add to it:

     3 tablespoons bread flour or 1½ tablespoons cornstarch
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Return it to the pan. Stir the berries until they boil and thicken. Add:

                                 Cakes


Cakes are divided into two classes:

  I. SPONGE CAKES.
 II. BUTTER CAKES.

Sponge cakes are made without butter.

Butter cakes call for butter or other shortening.

The following general rules apply to both types of cake, special rules
being given later:

The ingredients used in cakes must be measured accurately. The majority
of recipes are very carefully balanced, and this balance must not be
disturbed by careless measurements. All the measurements given in this
book are level, unless otherwise stated. All ingredients should be at
room temperature.

Flour and sugar should be sifted, the former before it is measured.
After being measured, the flour should be sifted three times. The sugar
need not be sifted again unless the recipe calls for it. These
ingredients should be handled separately. It is a help to use two
squares of stiff paper in sifting the sugar and flour. Bend the paper
when you wish to transfer these ingredients.

Use a tablespoon or a small scoop to handle the sugar and flour when
measuring them. Heap the flour lightly into a cup. Do not shake the cup.
Fill it to overflowing, then level off the top with a knife.

Cake flour makes a light and delicious cake. Use it whenever it is
available, but if bread flour is substituted use seven-eighths of a cup
instead of one cup of flour. In other words, fill the cup with flour,
level the top, then take out two tablespoonfuls. If cake flour is
substituted for bread flour, use one and an eighth cups instead of one
cup. In other words, fill the cup with flour, level the top, then add
two tablespoonfuls.

If flour has been exposed to moisture it will make a “streaky” cake. Be
sure to spread flour in shallow pans and dry it well in a slow oven
before using it if there is any doubt about its being dry, or sift it
four or five times before the open door of a hot oven. A definition of
baking terms will be found on page 816 and additional rules on page 813.
{pg 525}


                              Sponge Cakes

Beat the egg yolks until they are light and lemon colored. Add the
remaining ingredients as directed in the recipes, using sifted sugar and
sifted flour.

Do not beat a sponge cake batter unless the recipe calls for it. Fold in
the ingredients lightly until they are blended only—enclosing as much
air as possible.

Either the flour or the beaten egg whites may be folded in last. Do not
beat the egg whites until you are ready to use them. Add a few grains of
salt to the egg whites and beat them on a large platter, using a flat
wire egg beater. Beat them until they are stiff, stand up well in peaks
and keep their shape but not until they are dry.

Fold the stiffly beaten egg whites into the cake batter, that is, heap
them on the batter and with a downward motion of the spoon take up some
of the batter and fold it lightly over the egg whites. Enclose all the
air, do not stir or beat it out. Repeat this downward cut and upward
folding motion until the whole is blended.

Have a cake pan ready and pour the batter into it. The dough will cling
to the sides of the ungreased pan and will rise higher than if it were
greased.

Bake a sponge cake in a moderate oven—preheated to 325°—or place it in
a somewhat slower oven—300°—and bake it with a slightly increasing
heat. Heat the oven about fifteen minutes before using it. The oven
should be heated to the degree indicated before the cake is put into it.
Do not crowd the oven with pans. Place them so that the air may
circulate freely.

When baking a very large mold cake cover the top with a tin or with a
piece of waxed paper and place a pan of water on the upper grate. Remove
the tin when the cake has risen to the top of the pan. When the cake
begins to brown remove the pan of water.

Test the cake by inserting a wire cake tester or a straw. If the tester
emerges perfectly clean the cake is done. The cake should be lightly
browned and should be beginning to shrink from the sides of the pan. If
pressed with a finger it should at once come back into shape.

Remove the cake from the oven and invert the pan until the cake is
entirely cold, then run a knife around the sides and across the bottom
and remove the cake from the pan. Trim off the hard edges, if there are
any (there really should not be), sprinkle the cake with powdered sugar
or cover it with icing.

           RULE FOR MIXING SPONGE CAKE WITH AN ELECTRIC MIXER

Beat egg whites and salt in the large bowl at high speed until stiff,
about two to three minutes. Turn to low speed and add sugar gradually.
Then in the small bowl (without washing beater) beat egg yolks, lemon,
water, and vanilla at high speed for four minutes. Sift flour twice and
fold it by hand into beaten egg whites alternately with beaten yolks.


                              Butter Cakes

A definition of baking terms will be found on page 816 and additional
rules on page 813.

Remove the butter called for in the recipe from the icebox and put
{pg 526}it in a warm room. Permit it to become fairly soft but do not
permit it to melt, unless the recipe calls for melted butter. When the
butter has softened somewhat, beat it with a wooden cake spoon or work
it with the hand until it is creamy. Sift the sugar, add it slowly and
beat or work it into the butter until it is entirely dissolved. This
first step in the making of a butter cake is a very important one. Do
not hasten it. Cream the butter and sugar until they are fluffy and
foamy—like very thick cream.

Next beat in the egg yolks one by one. All ingredients should be at room
temperature.

Sift the flour, measure it and resift it with the baking powder. Add the
sifted ingredients in three or four parts to the butter mixture
alternately with one-third or one-fourth of the milk, or whatever liquid
is called for, until all the ingredients have been used. Beat the batter
after each addition of flour or liquid until the ingredients are well
blended. This will give the cake a fine grain. If beaten too long, the
cake will be close.

Place the egg whites on a large platter, add a few grains of salt and
whip them with a flat wire egg beater until they are stiff, stand in
peaks and hold their shape, but not until they are dry. Do not beat the
egg whites until you are ready to use them. Fold in the beaten egg
whites, that is, heap them upon the cake batter and with a downward
motion of the spoon take up some of the batter and fold it lightly over
the egg whites. Enclose all the air. Do not stir or beat it out. Repeat
this downward cut and upward folding motion until the ingredients are
blended.

Have a greased cake pan ready or a cake pan lined with waxed paper. Pour
the batter into it and bake the cake in a moderate oven—preheated to
350°—or place it in a somewhat slower oven—325°—and bake it with a
slightly increasing heat. Light the oven about twenty-five minutes
before using it. The oven should be heated to the degree indicated
before the cake is put into it. Do not crowd the oven with pans. Place
them so that the air may circulate freely.

When baking a very large mold cake cover the top with a tin or with a
piece of buttered paper and place a pan of water on the upper grate.
Remove the tin when the cake has risen to the top of the pan. When the
cake begins to brown remove the pan of water.

Test the cake by inserting a wire cake tester or a straw. If the tester
emerges perfectly clean the cake is done. The cake should be lightly
browned and should be beginning to shrink from the sides of the pan. If
pressed with a finger it should at once come back into shape.

Invert the cake pan for five minutes, then loosen the cake from the
sides and the bottom of the pan, invert it onto a plate and turn it
right side up on a cake cooler or on a rack so that the air may
circulate from the bottom. This will keep the crust dry and prevent it
from becoming soggy. Sprinkle the cake with powdered sugar or cover it
with icing.

          RULE FOR MIXING BUTTER CAKES WITH AN ELECTRIC MIXER

1. Combine sugar, shortening[1] and eggs (or egg yolks) and flavoring in
large mixing bowl and beat at high speed for three to four minutes.

2. Sift dry ingredients together while above mixture is being beaten.

3. Turn switch to medium speed.

4. Add sifted dry ingredients (about one-half cup at a time) alternately
{pg 527}with liquid, beating not more than two minutes. Combine as
quickly as possible to avoid overbeating.

5. Remove mixture from sides of bowl either by turning bowl in opposite
direction or by scraping sides.

6. If beaten egg whites are to be added separately beat them in a small
bowl before mixing the cake. Fold them into cake mixture: last, using
low speed.

[1] Shortening should be soft but not melted unless recipe specifies
melted shortening.

                           Quick Method Cakes

Be sure to read the chapter on cakes made by the modern method on page
813. You will find it both helpful and illuminating.


                              Sponge Cakes

The three following sponge cakes call for water and are exceptions to
the rule that sponge cake batter must not be beaten:

                         SPONGE CAKES I and II

These cakes call for the same ingredients but the manner of combining
them differs. Good results are obtained by either method. No. I has a
little more body than No. II and is more quickly prepared.

Fold them lightly into the cake batter. Bake the cake in an ungreased 9
inch tube pan in a slow oven 325° for about 50 minutes.

                        QUEEN MARY’S SPONGE CAKE

When King George was sick, his wife, who is reputed to have that in-born
thing, “a light hand with pastry,” bought a book of Marie Corelli’s and
baked a sponge cake for him. Her cake contains neither baking powder nor
cream of tartar, but depends for its lightness upon the air that is
first beaten and then folded into it. This recipe makes a large,
delicate, fine-grained cake, which, if somewhat uninteresting, makes up
for that by being highly digestible.

Sift:

     1 cup sugar

Grate onto the sugar, then stir in, the:

       Rind of 1 lemon

Beat until very light:

     6 egg yolks

Add the sugar gradually, beating constantly. Add:

     3 tablespoons lemon juice or 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon water

Beat these ingredients until they are blended. Whip until stiff but not
dry:

     6 egg whites
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Fold them lightly into the yolk mixture until they are partly blended.
Sift:

     1 cup cake flour

Fold the flour into the cake batter 1 tablespoonful at a time. When it
is blended pour the cake batter into an ungreased 9 inch tube pan. Bake
the cake in a slow oven 325° for about 1 hour.

                       RULE for ANGEL FOOD CAKES

It seems to be the desire of every novice to bake a perfect angel cake.
Fortunately, the accomplishment of this desire is entirely within reach,
although the goal may be attained by various ways. Use a fine sugar,
preferably berry or fruit sugar. Use fresh cream of tartar. Chilled eggs
separate easily. Egg whites at room temperature whip easily. Whip the
egg whites on a platter. Use a wire egg beater. Keep the egg beater
below the surface while beating. This makes the cake light. Whip the egg
whites until they are stiff but not dry. Stop when they barely will hold
a point that curls over and are still moist and foamy. Combine the cake
as directed in the following recipes.

Bake it in a slow to moderate oven—see Angel Cake I and II. Or bake it
by a new and very good method. Heat the oven to 425°. Place the cake in
it and bake it for 30 minutes. The high temperature will crack the top
of the cake. This is of no consequence, as the cake will be inverted
when it is done. The texture of an angel cake baked in this way is
wonderful.

Invert all angel cakes when taken from the oven. Remove them from the
pan 1½ hours later. The following cakes differ both in proportions and
in the manner of combining the ingredients. The first is light; the
second is so light it seems to melt away.

Serve the cakes dusted with:

       Powdered sugar

Or spread with any desired:

       Icing

Or cut crosswise into two layers filled and spread with:

       Whipped cream

                              ANGEL CAKE I

Sift twice:

    1½ cups sugar[1]

Sift separately before measuring:

     1 cup cake flour

Resift the flour three times with ½ cup of the sifted sugar and:

     ½ teaspoon salt

Place on a platter:

    1¼ cups egg whites (10 egg whites)
     2 tablespoons water or 1 tablespoon water and 1 tablespoon lemon
       juice (optional)

Whip them until they are foamy. Add:

     1 teaspoon cream of tartar

Whip them until they are stiff, but not dry. Gradually whip in gently,
about 1 teaspoonful at a time, 1 cupful of the sifted sugar. Fold in:

     ½ teaspoon vanilla
     ½ teaspoon almond extract

Fold in gradually, about 1 tablespoonful at a time, the sifted flour
mixture. Pour the batter into an ungreased 9 inch tube pan. Bake it in a
slow to moderate oven 325°, for about 1 hour or more. See preceding rule
for Angel Cakes.

This cake is usually made in layers and iced with a nut, raisin or other
icing. It is the batter for the famous Lady Baltimore Cake. White Cake
II calls for less butter and fewer eggs. It is more economical than
White Cake I and one-third smaller. Both cakes are superlative.

Sift:

     2 cups sugar

Beat until soft:

     1 cup butter

Add the sifted sugar gradually. Blend these ingredients until they are
very light and creamy. Sift before measuring:

    3½ cups cake flour

Resift it twice with:

     5 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 4 teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)
     ½ teaspoon salt

Add these ingredients in 3 parts to the butter mixture alternately with
thirds of:

     1 cup milk

Beat the batter until it is smooth after each addition. Beat in:

     1 teaspoon vanilla
     ¼ teaspoon almond extract (optional)

Whip until stiff, but not dry:

     7 or 8 egg whites
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Fold them lightly into the cake batter. Bake the cake in a greased 9 x
13 inch pan in a moderate oven 350° for about 40 minutes, or in three
greased 8 inch layer pans in a moderate oven 375° for about 25 minutes.

Sift:

    1½ cups sugar

Beat until soft:

     ½ cup butter

Add the sugar gradually. Blend these {pg 532}ingredients until they are
very light and creamy. Sift before measuring:

    2¼ cups cake flour

Resift twice with:

     3 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 2½ teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Add these ingredients in 3 parts to the butter mixture alternately with
thirds of:

     1 cup milk

Add:

     1 teaspoon vanilla or ½ teaspoon vanilla and ¼ teaspoon almond
       extract

Whip until stiff but not dry:

     4 egg whites
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Fold them lightly into the cake batter. This batter may be baked in a 9
inch tube pan, or in two 9 inch layer pans or in a 9 x 13 inch cake pan.
It is fine baked in the latter, iced with any thick icing, decorated
with nut meats and cut into cubes. Place the pans in a moderate oven
350°. Allow about 1 hour for a loaf cake and ½ hour or more for a flat
cake.

Note: I use this rule frequently to make a Marble Cake (page 534).
Sometimes I bake one white and one dark layer and use a Chocolate Icing.
There are not even crumbs left to mark the passing of this cake.

                          CAKE for a LAMB MOLD

Iron molds are made in two parts, in which a cake is baked in the shape
of a lamb. This lamb is covered with white icing and sprinkled
generously with grated cocoanut. A blue ribbon with a little bell or a
garland of decorative icing roses is placed around the lamb’s neck, a
red-hot forms its lips and raisins are used for its eyes. Children love
this cake. Follow the above rule for White Cake II. As it is unwise to
make this cake too light, cut the baking powder by ½ teaspoonful. Add:

     ¼ cup flour

Grease the upper and lower parts of the lamb mold well with:

       Butter or shortening

Use a pastry brush if available. Fill the lower half with the batter.
Cover it with the upper half. Bake the cake in a moderate oven 350° for
about 1 hour. Do not be at all alarmed if in taking the cake from the
mold the lamb promptly loses its head. It probably will, but by lifting
off the top mold and letting the cake cool first this danger may be
averted. If, however, it is not, stick the head on with some icing,
using a few toothpicks as armatures.

Prepare:

       White Icing (page 614) or Seven Minute Icing (page 618)

This makes a light coat. Increase the proportions by ½ for a heavier
coating of wool.

Press lightly onto the icing:

     ¼ to ½ pound grated cocoanut

If the tail is lost to sight, make a new one with additional icing. Bed
the lamb on ferns or shredded green paper and place a few small flowers
about it.

One newly-wed had to call upon all the inhabitants of her apartment
house to assist in the “accouchement” of her first lamb. The neighbor
who produced an old-fashioned hatpin to keep the head from toppling
until the icing hardened was voted the heroine of the hour. At that, the
ungrateful husband said the joint work of art looked “like an unknown
grave in winter,” but even he had to admit that a second attempt was a
triumph.

                            QUICK WHITE CAKE

A great deal can be said for this little cake. It is easily made,
remains moist a long time and calls for only two egg whites.

     ¼ teaspoon almond extract
     ½ teaspoon vanilla

Add the liquids to the other ingredients. Stir them until the flour is
dampened, then beat them vigorously for 1 minute. Bake the cake in two
greased 8 inch layer pans in a moderate oven 375° for about 25 minutes,
or in a 9 x 4 bread pan for a somewhat {pg 533}longer time. Spread the
cake with:

       Seven Minute Chocolate Icing (page 619)

Use only ½ the amount of ingredients given, or spread between the
layers:

       Lemon Filling (page 625)

This is fine as a complete dessert. Try icing the cake with White Icing
(page 614) and serving it with Foamy Sauce (page 671).

                           WHIPPED CREAM CAKE

Here comes something new! The result is the most melting of white cakes.
This recipe makes good cup cakes served with hot sauce and ice
cream—see page 576.

Sift before measuring:

     2 cups cake flour

Resift twice with:

    1½ cups sugar
     3 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 2 teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)
     ½ teaspoon salt

Whip until stiff:

     1 cup heavy cream

Whip until stiff but not dry:

     3 egg whites
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Combine the cream and the egg whites. Fold in:

     ½ cup water
     1 teaspoon vanilla or almond flavoring

Fold the sifted ingredients into the whipped cream mixture—a small
amount at a time. Bake the cake in a greased 9 inch tube pan in a
moderate oven 375° for about ¾ hour. Spread the cake with any good:

       Icing (page 614)

                               LADY CAKE

The following recipe is a good tube pan cake or loaf cake. It tastes and
looks like a traditional wedding cake, that is, traditional since fruit
cake fell from grace.

Sift:

     1 cup sugar

Beat until soft:

     ¾ cup butter

Add the sugar gradually. Blend these ingredients until they are very
light and creamy. Sift before measuring:

    1¾ cups cake flour

Resift twice with:

     2 teaspoons any baking powder

Add these ingredients in 3 parts to the butter mixture alternately with
thirds of:

     ½ cup milk

Beat the batter for a few minutes after each addition. Beat in:

     1 teaspoon almond extract
       Grated rind of 1 lemon

Whip until stiff but not dry:

     3 egg whites
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Fold them lightly into the cake batter. Bake the cake in a greased 9
inch tube pan in a moderate oven 350° for about 45 minutes. Sprinkle it
with:

       Powdered sugar

or spread it with:

       White Icing (page 614)

                        OLD-FASHIONED WHITE CAKE

A friend writes: “I venture to say that there cannot be a better recipe
than the following for white cake. It is mixed contrary to the usual
mode of making cake but it is the best mode for making it fine-grained
and delicate.”

Sift before measuring:

     2 cups cake flour

Add, then resift three times:

     1 teaspoon any baking powder or ¼ teaspoon soda and ½ teaspoon cream
       of tartar

Work until creamy:

       A scant ¾ cup butter

Work the flour mixture into the butter lightly with the finger tips
until smooth. Beat in:

    1½ tablespoons lemon juice

Beat until stiff:

     6 egg whites

Beat in gradually:

    1¼ cups confectioner’s sugar

Beat the egg-white mixture into the flour mixture with an egg whisk
until blended. Place the batter in two greased 8 inch layer pans or in a
4 x 10 loaf pan. Bake it in a moderate oven for about 25 minutes for the
layers and longer for the loaf cake. Ice the cake with any desired
icing. {pg 534}

                            MOCK POUND CAKE

The following recipe calls for milk, so it is not the “genuine article,”
but it is a mighty fine cake.

Follow the rule for:

       White Cake I (page 531)

Use only:

     6 egg whites or 4 eggs separated[1]

Flavor the cake as directed. The old recipes add:

     1 teaspoon lemon juice
     6 drops rose water or 1 or more tablespoons brandy
     1 cup chopped nut meats

Bake the cake in a greased tube pan in a moderate oven for about 1 hour.

                               POUND CAKE

This contribution, gratefully acknowledged, comes from an unknown
Seattle friend whose family has used this rule for many years. She
writes: “I use an electric mixer so creaming is easy.”

Cream thoroughly:

     2 cups butter (do not use substitutes)

When you think you have creamed it enough cream some more. Slowly
“dribble in”:

     2 cups sugar

beating and creaming well. Cream for quite a while after the sugar is
added. Beat in one at a time:

     9 eggs

Beat the batter well after each addition. Add:

     1 teaspoon vanilla
     ½ teaspoon mace[1]

Sift before measuring:

     4 cups cake flour

Resift with:

     ½ teaspoon cream of tartar
     ½ teaspoon salt

“Dribble in” the sifted ingredients slowly, at lowest speed, mixing
until thoroughly blended only. Pour the batter into two greased loaf
pans lined with heavy waxed paper. Bake the cake in a slow oven 325° for
about 1 hour.

Note: Many pound cake recipes call for 2 tablespoonfuls brandy or 8
drops of rose water in addition to the other flavorings.

[1] Sometimes I add to ½ the mixture ½ cupful each of candied cherries,
pineapple, citron and white raisins and have a delicious fruit cake.

        RULE for MIXING YELLOW LOAF CAKE with an ELECTRIC MIXER

Have butter at room temperature. It should be soft but not melted unless
the recipe calls for melted butter. Beat it at high speed for 1 minute.
Scrape the sides of the bowl. Continue to beat at high speed. Add the
egg yolks, unbeaten, one at a time. Add the sugar gradually. Scrape the
sides of the bowl. Continue to beat for 1 minute. Turn to low speed. Add
the sifted ingredients in about three parts, alternately with thirds of
the liquid. Do this quickly.[1] Scrape the sides of the bowl. Beat in
the scrapings until blended only. Fold in the beaten egg whites by hand.

-----

[1] These ingredients may be stirred in by hand until blended only. It
is unwise to beat or stir a cake unnecessarily after adding the sifted
ingredients. Overbeating results in close, tough cake.

Follow the above rule for:

       Hurry-up Cake

Substitute for the white sugar:

     1 cup medium brown sugar closely packed

You may add to the batter:

     ¾ cup nut meats
     ¾ cup chopped dates

Spread the cake with:

       Caramel Icing (page 616)

Decorate it with:

       Nut meats (optional)

The addition of the dates and nut meats calls for three 8 inch cake pans
or 2 somewhat larger pans. If served at tea it is easier to handle baked
in a 9 x 12 inch pan. Ice the cake. Cut it into squares. Decorate each
square with a nut meat.

                            Chocolate Cakes

After entertaining, I often wonder whether it is worth while to bake
anything but chocolate cake. What unusual quality gives this particular
food such an overwhelming popularity? Undoubtedly, chocolate cake has
“it.”

The following recipes have been very carefully chosen. Each cake is
distinctive in flavor and texture.

                         CHOCOLATE SPONGE CAKE

This is a fine, light chocolate cake. As it requires no butter, it is
not rich and is therefore a good cake to bake for children. It gives a
very generous return for the little it calls for.

Sift:

     2 cups sugar

Melt over hot water:

    3½ ounces chocolate

Add:

     1 cup milk

and 1 cup of the sifted sugar. Cook and stir the mixture until it is
smooth. Beat until light:

     4 egg yolks

Add gradually the second cup of sifted sugar. Beat until these
ingredients are well blended. Stir in the hot chocolate mixture. Sift
before measuring:

    1¼ cups cake flour

Resift with:

     3 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 2½ teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Add these ingredients to the batter with:

     ½ teaspoon vanilla

Stir them until they are well blended. Whip until stiff but not dry:

     4 egg whites

Fold them lightly into the batter. Bake the cake in an ungreased 9 inch
tube pan, or in three 8 inch layer pans in a slow oven 325°. Allow about
50 minutes for a loaf and 20 to 25 minutes for a layer cake. Permit the
cake {pg 540}to become cold in the pan. Do not invert it. Ice it with:

       White Icing and Chocolate Coating (page 615) or Chocolate Icing
       (page 617)

                 *        *        *        *        *

    Chocolate Date Cake or Torte, page 571.

    A sponge cake much like the preceding one. It may be baked in a
    9 inch tube pan as well as in layers. A marvelous cake. Thanks
    to the orange rind it tastes like curaçao.

                             CHOCOLATE CAKE

Cool this mixture slightly. Sift:

Resift with:

     4 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 3 teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Add these ingredients in 3 parts to the butter mixture alternately with
thirds of:

     ½ cup milk

Beat the batter until it is smooth after each addition. Add:

     1 teaspoon vanilla

Whip until stiff but not dry:

     4 egg whites

Fold them lightly into the cake batter. Bake the cake in a greased 9 x
13 inch pan in a moderate oven 350° for about ½ hour. Spread the top
with thick:

       White Icing with Chocolate Coating (page 615) or Chocolate
       Peppermint Icing (page 615)

                 *        *        *        *        *

                      BLACK WALNUT CHOCOLATE CAKE

Follow the preceding rule for:

       Chocolate Cake

Fold into the batter before the egg whites are added:

     1 cup coarsely chopped black walnut or other nut meats or
     ¾ cup grated cocoanut

                 *        *        *        *        *

                               FUDGE CAKE

A flat, rich chocolate cake.

Beat in:

     3 egg yolks

     1 teaspoon vanilla
     ½ cup broken nut meats

Whip until stiff but not dry:

     3 egg whites
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Fold them lightly into the batter. Line an 8 x 8 pan or a 9 inch layer
pan with waxed paper. Pour the batter into it. Bake the cake in a slow
oven 300° for about ¾ hour. My neighbor, who has a youthful stomach,
says: “Do not let it be very well done—keep it soggy.” That, however,
is an individual matter.

               CHOCOLATE DEVIL’S FOOD III (Custard Cake)

A smooth, fine-grained cake. Two chocolate measurements are given. When

Having firmly made up my mind that this collection contained enough

     1 cup and 6 tablespoons cake flour

Resift with:

     2 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 1⅓ teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)
     ¼ teaspoon soda
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Add the sifted ingredients to the butter mixture in 3 parts alternately
with thirds of:

     ½ cup milk

Beat the batter until it is smooth after each addition. Add the prunes
and:

     ½ teaspoon vanilla

Bake the cake in two greased 8 inch layer pans in a moderate oven 375°
for about 25 minutes. Spread the layers with:

       Chocolate Butter Icing (page 621)

Make only ½ the amount given. That will be sufficient for the top of
this moderate-sized cake. Put the left-over ½ egg in the icing.

            CHOCOLATE CHIP or POLKA DOT CAKE (Loaf or Layer)

Shaved semisweet chocolate may be added to any cake batter in about the
same proportion as nut meats or raisins. The heavier commercial
chocolate[1] shot, chips, or variously named chocolate morsels that are
used in cookies, are a little heavy for light batters, so sprinkle
one-half the chocolate bits over one-half the batter and scatter the
other half over the top of the cake before baking it. Use a recipe for
loaf or layer cake. Bake it as directed. Ice it as desired.

-----

[1] Approximately 2 ounces semisweet chocolate shaved or ½ cupful chips.

                              MYSTERY CAKE

This curious combination of ingredients makes a good cake. It would not
occur to me to bake it for my own purposes, as I have many others to
choose from that are better, but it is suited ideally to the needs of
numerous allergic friends, as it calls for neither eggs, milk nor
butter. The following Economy Spice Cake comes under the same heading.

Sift:

     1 cup sugar

Beat until soft:

     2 tablespoons shortening

     1 cup nut meats
     1 cup raisins

Bake the cake in a greased 9 inch tube pan in a moderate oven 350° for
about 45 minutes. Spread the cake with:

       White Icing II (page 620)

     2 cups seeded raisins
     1 cup brown sugar
     ⅓ cup shortening
     ½ teaspoon cinnamon
     ½ teaspoon allspice
     ½ teaspoon salt
     ⅛ teaspoon nutmeg

Cool these ingredients. Sift before measuring:

     2 cups cake flour

Resift with:

     1 teaspoon any baking powder
     1 teaspoon soda

Stir the flour gradually into the other ingredients. Beat the batter
until it is smooth. Add:

     1 cup chopped nut meats[1] (optional)

                            CRUMB SPICE CAKE

This really deserves mention of some kind but I have run out of
adjectives.

Sift before measuring:

    2½ cups bread flour

Sift into the same bowl:

    2½ cups dark brown sugar

In another bowl beat until soft:

     ¾ cup butter or shortening

Add the combined flour and sugar gradually and blend the ingredients
lightly until they crumble. Work them with a pastry blender or the
fingertips. Do not permit them to become oily. Measure 1 cupful of the
crumbs thus formed. Add to them:

     ¾ teaspoon cinnamon
     ¼ cup blanched, shredded almonds or other chopped nut meats

Reserve these crumbs. To the remainder add:

     ½ teaspoon soda
     ½ teaspoon salt
     ¼ teaspoon nutmeg or cloves[1]
     ½ teaspoon cinnamon
     2 teaspoons any baking powder

Beat well, then add:

     1 cup sour milk
     2 eggs

Beat the batter until it is smooth. Spread it in a greased 9 x 12 inch
pan. Bake the cake in a moderate oven 375° for 20 minutes. Sprinkle the
reserved crumbs over the top. Bake it about 10 minutes longer.

-----

[1] The spices may be omitted from the cake batter but retained in the
crumb topping. We have never been able to make up our minds about the
matter so I am passing it on unsolved for your consideration.

                            PRUNE SPICE CAKE

A moist, rich cake, which keeps fresh for a week or more. It is good as
a loaf or layer cake with any kind of icing but is best baked in one
large layer, iced with unboiled white icing flavored with rum, decorated
with nuts and cut into small shapes. Recently I have been serving it
uniced with foamy sauce (and great success). This may be done with other
rich spice cakes. Choose a sauce that is less rich if you prefer it. See
page 670.

Sift:

     1 cup sugar

Beat until soft:

     1 cup shortening[1]

Add the sugar gradually. Blend these ingredients until they are very
light and creamy. Beat in one at a time:

     2 eggs

Beat in:

     1 cup prune pulp[2]

Sift before measuring:

    1½ cups cake flour

Resift with:

    1½ teaspoons soda
     1 teaspoon cinnamon
     ¾ teaspoon cloves
     ½ teaspoon salt

Add the sifted ingredients in 3 parts to the butter mixture alternately
with thirds of:

     ½ cup sour milk

Beat the batter after each addition until it is smooth. Stir in:

     ½ cup broken nut meats

This makes two 9 inch layers or a 9 inch tube pan cake. Grease the pans.
Bake the layers for 25 minutes in a moderate oven 375°. Bake the loaf
cake in a somewhat slower oven 350° with slightly increasing heat for
about 1 hour. Spread the cake with any: Icing (page 614)

     ¼ teaspoon cloves
     ½ teaspoon soda

Add the sifted ingredients to the butter mixture in about 3 parts
alternately with thirds of the milk and fig juice. Beat the batter after
each addition until it is smooth. Add the figs and:

     1 teaspoon vanilla
     1 cup broken nut meats or raisins

Bake the cake in a greased 9 inch tube pan or an 8 by 10 inch pan in a
moderate oven 350° for about 50 minutes. Spread it with:

       Unboiled Chocolate, Coffee or Mocha Icing (pages 621-622)

contemptuously familiar. Try this one.

Sift:

     1 cup sugar

Beat until soft:

     ⅓ cup butter

Add the sifted sugar gradually. Blend these ingredients until they are
very light and creamy. Beat in one at a time:

     ⅔ cup jam[1]

Add the remaining sifted ingredients. Beat the batter after each
addition until it is smooth. Fold in:

     ½ cup broken nut meats

This cake may be baked in two 9 inch layers or in a loaf or tube pan.
Grease the pans. Bake the layers for about 30 minutes and the tube cake
for about 50 minutes in a moderate oven 350°. Spread the cake with:

       White Icing (page 614) or some other icing

                              Fruit Cakes

Here are three recipes for very good dark fruit cake. Basically they
have nearly the same ingredients, but they differ in flavor. While they
all call for brandy or wine, fruit juice may be substituted. No. II
calls in addition for grape jelly and grape juice. No. III calls for
molasses and sour milk. This is the darkest and the heaviest of the
three.

                              FRUIT CAKE I

About 12 Pounds

Sift:

     1 pound brown sugar (2⅔ cups)

Beat until soft:

     1 pound butter (2 cups)

Add the sugar gradually. Blend these ingredients until they are very
light and creamy. Beat in:

    15 beaten egg yolks

Sift before measuring:

     4 cups bread flour

Reserve 1 cupful. Resift the remainder {pg 549}with:

     1 tablespoon cinnamon
     1 tablespoon cloves
     1 tablespoon allspice
     1 tablespoon nutmeg
     ½ tablespoon mace
    1½ teaspoon salt (if butter is unsalted)

Add the sifted ingredients to the butter mixture alternately with:

     ¼ cup whisky and ¼ cup wine or ½ cup thick fruit juice (prune,
       apricot, grape, etc.)

Wash:

    2½ pounds currants

Cut up:

    2½ pounds raisins
     1 pound citron

Break coarsely:

     1 pound pecan meats

Sprinkle these ingredients well with the reserved cupful of flour. Beat
until stiff but not dry:

    15 egg whites

Fold them into the butter mixture. Fold in the floured ingredients.
Place the dough in loaf pans lined with a layer of heavy waxed paper or
with four layers of thin waxed paper. Cover the bottom of the oven with
shallow pans filled with 1 inch of hot water and bake the loaves in a
very slow oven 300° from 2 to 3 hours. The pans may be removed for the
last 15 minutes. Permit the loaves to cool and remove them from the
pans. Remove the waxed paper, wrap the loaves in fresh waxed paper and
store the cake in tightly covered tin boxes. Should the cake become dry,
place it in a closed container over hot water until it is hot. Heat wine
or grape juice (but do not let it boil) and pour it from a small pitcher
very slowly, drop by drop, onto the hot cake. Use as much as the cake
will absorb.

Is there anything better than good coffee cake? I am told that the late
former King of Spain “dunked.” Perhaps that afforded him some comfort.

                BASIC RULE for COFFEE CAKE DOUGH (Yeast)

For a richer dough see the rule for Coffee Cake Wreath on page 553. This
is sufficient for one 9 x 13 inch coffee cake, one fruit cake baked in 8
inch pie pan and 14 or 16 two and a half inch crescents. See the
following recipes.

Warm a large mixing bowl. Place in it:

     ½ cup bread flour

Crumble over it:

     1 cake yeast

Make a hollow in the flout and pour into it:

     ½ cup lukewarm milk and water

Add:

    1½ teaspoons sugar

Stir these ingredients until they are well blended. Cover them and put
them in a warm place to rise for 20 minutes. Beat until soft:

     ½ cup butter

Add gradually:

     ½ cup sugar[1]

Blend these ingredients until they are creamy. Add:

     ½ teaspoon salt
     1 teaspoon grated lemon rind

     2 beaten eggs
     1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
     ½ cup water and milk

Sift:

     4 cups bread flour

Stir part of it into the butter mixture, then knead in the rest with the
hands. Add the yeast mixture and knead the dough well. Cover it and
permit it to rise in a warm place for 3 or 4 hours (until it has doubled
in bulk). Shape the dough as desired. Add to it a filling (page 553) or
cover it with butter, sugar, etc. Permit it to rise for ½ hour. Bake it
in a moderate oven 350° for about 20 minutes.

Make a hollow in the center into which pour:

     6 cups milk
     1 pound melted butter
     2 cups sugar
     ½ teaspoon grated lemon rind
     3 tablespoons lemon juice

                        RULE for WHIPPING CREAM

Chill the cream, the bowl and the beater. Use a heavy wire whisk.

Beat:

     1 cup heavy cream

Beat it until it is fairly stiff. (Be careful not to beat it until it is
warm or it will turn to butter.) Fold in:

     2 tablespoons confectioner’s sugar (optional)
     1 teaspoon vanilla, coffee or other flavoring

If you wish the cream to keep stiff for a day or two add to it:

     1 teaspoon gelatine soaked in 1 tablespoon cold water

Dissolve the gelatine over heat. Cool it.

When whipping cream with an electric beater use medium speed. {pg 557}

                 *        *        *        *        *

                   Rule for WHIPPING EVAPORATED MILK

Here are two ways of preparing evaporated milk for whipping. Milk
prepared by the first method holds up longer, but I find the second very
convenient at times.

I.

Soak:

     ½ teaspoon gelatine

in:

     2 teaspoons cold water

Scald in a double boiler:

    1¼ cups evaporated milk

Add the soaked gelatine. Stir until the gelatine is dissolved. Chill the
milk until it is icy cold, then whip it like cream. A small amount of
vanilla, caramel, coffee, etc., may be added to the milk to flavor it.

II.

Place a can of evaporated milk in a pan of cold water. Bring the water
to the boiling point. Remove the can from the water. When it is cool
place it in the refrigerator. Chill it well. The milk will keep for
days. Whip it when ready to use it.

When whipping evaporated milk with an electric beater use medium speed.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                    A SUBSTITUTE for WHIPPING CREAM

This calls for 1 pint 18% cream. Reduce the quantities given by one-half
for 1 cup of cream.

Soak:

     1 teaspoon gelatine

in:

     2 tablespoons cold water[1]

Heat:

     ½ cup 18% cream

Dissolve the soaked gelatine in it. Stir these ingredients into:

    1½ cups 18% cream

You may add:

     1 tablespoon powdered sugar

Place the cream in the refrigerator. Stir it from time to time. Add:

     ½ teaspoon vanilla

When the cream is thoroughly chilled (after 4 to 6 hours) beat it until
it is stiff.

-----

[1] Fruit juice may be substituted.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                         RULE for WHIPPING EGGS

Cold eggs separate easily. Egg whites at room temperature whip easily.
Whip egg whites on a platter. (The addition of a little salt tends to
stiffen them.) Use a flat, light wire egg beater. When whipping egg
whites with an electric beater use high speed.

                 *        *        *        *        *

    Meringue, page 510.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                           THREE MINUTE ICING

Use this icing as a substitute for whipped cream or meringue.

Beat until blended, then place in a double boiler over boiling water:

     2 unbeaten egg whites
     ½ cup sugar
     ⅛ teaspoon salt
     2 tablespoons cold water

Beat these ingredients for 3 minutes or until stiff with a wire whisk.
Remove the icing from the fire. Add:

     1 teaspoon vanilla or almond extract

Beat the icing well. Spread it over jellied fruit, pies or tarts, cakes,
etc., that have been cooled. Top it with:

       Chopped nut meats or cocoanut

                 *        *        *        *        *

                           RULE for GELATINE

Gelatine must be soaked in a cold liquid before it is dissolved.
Dissolve it by adding it to a hot liquid—water, milk, custard, etc.—or
by placing the receptacle holding it in boiling water or over a low
flame. If a mold is to be used for gelatine puddings wet it before
filling it or grease it lightly with oil. This will prevent the pudding
from sticking to the mold. To set a gelatine dish rapidly, place the
receptacle containing it in a bowl of ice water.

baked, or baked with the fruit in the bottom of the pan and the dough on
top. It is usually served with Hard Sauce, Butter Sauce, etc. (see
Pudding Sauces, page 672). It is advisable to thicken the fruit.
Combine:

     3 cups prepared fruit (apples, peaches, plums, etc.)

                             APPLE STRUDEL

Strudel is to the Hungarian what pie and biscuit are to the American.
Flour, egg and water are combined with a little salt and are kneaded
until they become so elastic that the dough can be stretched until it is
as thin as paper. This is done on a large table covered with a cloth.
The dough is then sprinkled with fruit or vegetables, butter or cream
and nuts, rolled like a huge jelly roll, twisted into a pan and baked in
a moderate oven. The result is superlative.

Sift into a bowl:

    1½ cups bread flour
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Add:

     1 beaten egg

Heat until lukewarm and add:

     ½ cup water or milk

Combine the ingredients quickly with {pg 562}a pastry blender. Knead the
dough on a board until it is elastic and no longer sticks to the board.
Place it on a floured board and cover it with a warm bowl for 30
minutes. Work into the dough:

     2 tablespoons melted butter

Place it in the center of a large table covered with a floured cloth.
Gently pull and stretch the dough, placing both hands under it, until it
is as thin as paper. Be careful not to tear it. (Strudel is stretched to
tremendous dimensions, 2 x 2 yards or more.) Spread the dough with:

     4 pounds tart apples,[1] finely chopped
    1½ cups raisins and currants
    1½ teaspoons cinnamon
     ¼ pound almonds, blanched and shredded
     1 cup sugar
     5 tablespoons melted butter

Fold the dough over one side, hold up the tablecloth and let the strudel
roll into a huge roll. Twist the roll into a large, greased pan or cut
it into pieces and trim the edges. Bake the strudel for ½ hour in a hot
oven 400°, reduce the heat to 350° and bake it until it is crisp and
brown. Serve it before it is cold.

substituted.

                        APPLE CRISP or PARADISE

6 Servings

This is the best dessert imaginable when made with good cooking apples.
It is a very indifferent one made with poor ones.

Peel, core and slice into a 7 x 7 pan:

     3 pounds tart apples (7 or 8 large cooking apples)[1]

(If you wish to serve the cake at table, use an oven-proof pie dish.)

The apple layer when cooked should be about ¾ inch thick. If the apples
are dry and sweet dot them with:

       Butter

Sprinkle them with:

       Lemon juice and grated rind

The success of this dish depends upon the flavor of the apples, which
should be tart. A good apple needs no additional ingredients. Work like
pastry with a pastry blender or a knife (the fingertips may be used, but
the mixture must be lightly worked so that it does not become oily):

     1 cup bread flour[2]
     1 cup brown sugar
     ½ cup butter
     ½ teaspoon salt (if butter is unsalted)
     1 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)

Spread these ingredients over the apples. They may crumble, but that is
unimportant. Bake the cake in a moderate oven 375° for about 30 minutes
or until the apples are done. Serve it hot or cold, with or without:

       Cream

-----

[1] Four cups diced rhubarb (use lemon juice and rind) or 3 cups pitted
cherries may be substituted.

[2] This is the original recipe. Some cooks find this topping too heavy
and prefer using only one-half of these measurements.

             GRANDMOTHER’S SOUR CREAM APPLE CAKE or SOUFFLÉ

Serves 12 people or more

This dish is always referred to as Apfelkuchen but it is really a Torte.
When properly made it might be classed as a soufflé, but no matter what
it is called or how it is made, it is a remarkably good dessert.

Pare, core and slice:

     5 cups tart apples

Melt in a skillet:

     ¼ cup butter

Add the apples and cook them covered over a very low fire, stirring them
from time to time until they are tender. Combine and pour over the
apples:

     ½ cup sour cream
       Rind and juice of 1 lemon
     1 cup sugar (scant unless apples are very tart)
     2 tablespoons bread flour
     8 egg yolks
     ½ cup blanched, shredded almonds (optional)

Stir these ingredients over a low fire until they thicken. Remove the
skillet from the fire. Cool the mixture. Whip until stiff but not dry:

     8 egg whites
     ½ teaspoon salt

Fold them lightly into the apple mixture. Spread the soufflé to the
thickness of one inch in a large pan or oven-proof dish. Sprinkle the
top with a mixture of: {pg 563}

       Sugar
       Cinnamon
       Dry bread crumbs
     ¼ cup blanched, shredded almonds

Bake it in a moderate oven 325° until it is firm—about 45 minutes. As
all the ingredients, except the egg whites, are cooked before they are
baked, the cake may be eaten at any time, but it is advisable to bake it
until the egg whites are set. It may be served hot, but it is best very
cold, covered with:

       Whipped cream (flavored with vanilla) or with Angelica Ice Cream
       (page 687)

Combine and work with the fingertips until well blended:

    1½ cups Zwieback crumbs (4½ oz.)
     ¾ cup sugar
     ¾ teaspoon cinnamon
     ½ cup melted butter

Press the crumbs on the bottom and against the sides of a 9 inch
oven-proof baking dish to form a shell less than ¼ inch thick. This
shell may be filled at once, but it is much better when chilled for
several hours. Fill the shell with:

       Cherry Custard

Beat:

     3 eggs

Add:

     ½ cup sugar
     ¾ cup sour cream
     2 cups pitted and drained cherries, fresh or canned

Bake the cake in a moderate oven 325° until the custard is firm. Serve
it hot or very cold.

       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)
     ⅓ teaspoon salt

Add the sifted ingredients in about 3 parts to the butter mixture
alternately with thirds of:

     ½ cup milk

Beat the batter after each addition until it is smooth. Bake the cake in
two greased 8[1] inch layer pans in a moderate oven 375° for about 25
minutes. Place between the layers a filling of:

       Whipped cream
       A cooked Cake Filling (page 623, usually custard filling, or jam,
       jelly, cooked or sugared fruit)

Sprinkle the top with:

       Confectioner’s sugar

or spread it with:

       Whipped cream

combination.


                              Layer Cakes

To me layer cake is a complete course. Unfortunately, it is frequently
served in addition to a dessert, which dwarfs it.

After a long period abroad nothing could make me more homesick or
emotional than an American magazine ad of a luscious layer cake, except
one, and that was a pictured lemon pie.

When serving layer cake you need not stick to the usual white or
chocolate icing. Try a cream, butterscotch or fruit filling. There isn’t
anything better than plain sponge cake layers filled with sweetened pie
{pg 564}cherries topped with whipped cream. Or serve a cake as suggested
under the preceding Washington or Boston Cream Pie. Also see the chapter
on Cake Icings and Fillings (page 613).

The many tiered Hungarian chocolate cake that looks rich, is rich and
enriches all who eat it.

Beat until light and lemon colored:

     5 egg yolks

Beat in gradually:

     ½ cup sugar

(My old recipe says cheerfully beat for ½ hour or longer.) Add:

     ½ teaspoon vanilla

Sift before measuring:

     ½ cup cake flour

Resift 4 times with:

     ¼ teaspoon salt

Beat in the sifted ingredients gradually. Whip until stiff:

     5 egg whites

Fold them into the batter. Bake the cake in 9 layers (use a greased 7½
or 8 inch layer cake pan) in a moderate oven 375° for about 5 to 8
minutes. Spread between the layers the following filling.

Place in a double boiler:

     ½ cup sugar
     1 inch vanilla bean[1]
     4 large eggs

Beat until the eggs begin to thicken. Cool the filling slightly. Cut
into pieces and dissolve:

     ¼ pound bittersweet chocolate
     2 tablespoons boiling water

Keep this warm. Cream until light:

     ⅞ cup butter (1¾ sticks)

Add the chocolate mixture. Beat this into the egg mixture. This filling
may also be spread over the top and sides of the cake, but the true
Hungarian will content himself with the filling spread between layers
only. The best-looking layer is reserved for the top and a caramel glaze
crowns the chef d’œuvre. Melt and brown in a skillet:

     3 tablespoons sugar

Pour it over the cake. Spread it with a hot knife. “Rest” the cake in a
cool place for 12 or more hours.

this time or bake the batter for exactly seven minutes and sprinkle it
over the layers without removing the pans from the oven. Bake the cake
in a moderate oven 375° for about ½ hour. Remove the cake from the pans
at once. The candy should be in creamy lumps throughout the cake. Spread
the cake with:

                              ORANGE CAKE

Most rules for orange cake prove to be disappointing, for upon reading
them you find that they are merely sponge or butter cake with an orange

                          ALMOND CAKE or TORTE

The following recipe is the well-known German “Mandeltorte.” In order to
have the right result the almonds should be put through an almond
grinder (not a meat grinder). This recipe must be starred as “the” nut
cake my friends so frequently ask for. It may be baked in a loaf or in
layers. This amount serves 6 to 8 people.

Sift:

     1 cup sugar

Beat:

     6 egg yolks

Add the sugar gradually and beat until these ingredients are very
creamy. Add:

       Grated rind and juice of 1 lemon (or small orange)
     1 teaspoon cinnamon
     ½ teaspoon almond extract (optional)
     1 cup unblanched almonds, ground
     ½ cup toasted white bread crumbs

Whip until stiff but not dry:

     6 egg whites
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Fold them lightly into the batter. This cake is very light and
consequently difficult to remove from the pan. Bake it in an 8 inch tube
pan in a moderate oven 350°. Permit it to cool in the pan. Spread it
with:

       Chocolate Butter Icing (page 621)

Or bake it in two 8 inch layer pans lined with waxed paper. Spread
between the layers:

       Lemon and Orange Filling (page 625)

Spread the top with:

       Confectioner’s sugar

When making a large cake, double or triple this recipe and use pans with
a removable rim in order to facilitate handling it. Spread the layers
with:

       Lemon and Orange Filling (page 625)

Spread the cake with:

       White Icing (page 614) or Chocolate Butter Icing (page 621)

In the following recipe for the well-known Brodtorte, the ingredients
differ only slightly from those in the preceding Mandeltorte, but the
results thanks to the wine bath, are amazingly different.

Sift:

     1 cup sugar

Beat:

     6 egg yolks

Add the sugar gradually. Beat these ingredients until they are creamy.
Combine and add:

     ½ teaspoon baking powder
     ½ teaspoon cinnamon
     ⅛ pound citron, cut fine
     1 cup unblanched almonds, ground in a grinder
       Rind and juice of 1 lemon

Whip until stiff but not dry: {pg 575}

     6 egg whites
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Fold them lightly into the cake batter. Bake the cake for 1 hour or more
in a pan with a removable rim in a moderate oven 350°. When the cake is
removed from the oven pour over it at once the following mixture,
strained. Heat but do not boil:

     ¾ cup sherry wine[1]
     2 tablespoons water
     2 whole cloves
     1 stick of cinnamon
     ¼ cup sugar

Strain these ingredients and place them in a small pitcher. Pour them
very slowly onto the hot cake. When all the liquid has been absorbed
cool the cake and remove it from the pan. Spread the cake with:

       Creamy Chocolate Filling or Icing (page 624)

                              LINZERTORTE

The following recipe is for a delicious German “company” cake. It looks
like an open jam pie and, being rich, is usually served in thin wedges.

Sift:

     1 cup sugar

Beat until soft:

     ⅞ cup butter

Add the sugar gradually. Blend these ingredients until they are very
light and creamy. Add:

     1 teaspoon grated lemon rind

Beat in, one at a time:

     2 eggs

Stir in gradually:

    1¼ cups sifted bread flour
     1 cup unblanched almonds, ground in a nut grinder
     ½ teaspoon cinnamon
     ¼ teaspoon cloves
     1 tablespoon cocoa
     ¼ teaspoon salt

The German recipe reads, “Stir for one hour,” but of course no
highgeared {pg 576}American has time for that. If the dough is very
soft, chill it. Roll it to the thickness of ⅛ inch between sheets of
waxed paper. Put it into an oven-proof dish, giving it a good edge.
Cover the bottom of the cake generously with a good quality of:

       Jam, preserves or apple butter

Roll the remaining dough into strips. Make a lattice over the
preserves.[1] Bake the cake in a hot oven 400°. Before serving it fill
the hollows with additional preserves.

-----

[1] If the room is warm and the dough is temperamental, place the dough
in a pastry tube and make the strips by forcing the dough through the
bag.

A recipe of the famous restaurant keeper Frau Sacher, who fed the
impoverished Austrian nobility long after they had ceased to pay. (She

                              CREAM PUFFS

Please cease to think of these as {pg 577}something to try out in your
more adventurous moments. Try them at any time. They will soon prove to
be stand-bys.

This is the rule to use for Puff Shells I and II. It will make 6 large
puffs or éclairs or 35 one inch puffs.

Sift before measuring:

     ½ cup bread flour

Heat:

     ½ cup milk or water

Add:

     ¼ cup butter

Bring these ingredients to the boiling point. Add the sifted flour and:

     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Cook and stir the batter until it leaves the sides of the pan and forms
a ball. Remove it from the fire. Beat in, one at a time:

     2 eggs

Be careful to beat one egg until well blended before adding the other.
Place spoonfuls of batter in 2 inch rounds on a greased tin, heaping
them well in the center. Allow 2 inches between the puffs. (In France
the dough is chilled before being baked.) Bake them in a hot oven 400°
for ½ hour. Reduce the heat to 350°. Bake them 5 minutes longer. Test
the puffs by removing one from the oven. If it does not fall it is
thoroughly done. When the puffs are cool cut a gash in the side of each
puff and fill them with:

       Sweetened, flavored whipped cream or Custard Filling (see below)

Ice the éclairs with:

       Chocolate Icing, etc. (see this page—optional)

                 *        *        *        *        *

                            CUSTARD FILLING

Scald:

    1½ cups milk

Combine and add:

    1½ tablespoons cornstarch
     ¼ teaspoon salt
     5 tablespoons sugar

When these ingredients are well blended pour them over:

     2 slightly beaten egg yolks

Stir and cook the custard in a double boiler or over a very low flame
until it is thick. Cool it and add:

     ½ teaspoon vanilla

                 *        *        *        *        *

                             COFFEE FILLING

Follow the rule preceding for:

       Custard Filling

Substitute for the milk:

     ½ cup strong coffee
     1 cup cream or rich milk

Ice the puffs with:

       French Coffee Icing (page 622)

                 *        *        *        *        *

                           CHOCOLATE FILLING

Follow the preceding rule for:

       Custard Filling

Add to the hot milk:

     1 ounce of chocolate, melted
     3 tablespoons sugar

                 *        *        *        *        *

                            CHOCOLATE ICING

Use one-half the amount of:

       Chocolate Butter Icing (page 621)

In Europe an individual is frequently served with five or six small
puffs. They are filled with sweetened and flavored whipped cream and are
glazed with burnt sugar. Stir and melt sugar in a heavy skillet over
moderate heat. When it is clear and brown, spread it on the puffs with a
hot spatula.

                           CHOCOLATE ÉCLAIRS

Prepare the preceding:

       Cream Puffs

Shape the batter with a spoon or a tube into oblongs. Heap it well in
the centers. Bake the puffs as directed. Fill them with:

       Whipped cream or Custard or Chocolate Custard Filling (see above)

Cover them with:

       Chocolate Icing (page 617)

                               MERINGUES

If you are cursed with a mental hazard in regard to meringues dismiss
it. This is an easily made, delicious dessert. Its success depends upon
beating the egg whites until they are stiff, adding the sugar very
slowly and in baking the meringues as directed. Meringues may be made
several days in advance. Please read the note under the following “Pinch
Pie.”

Sift:

    1½ cups sugar

Add: {pg 578}

     ⅛ teaspoon salt

to:

     7 egg whites

Beat them until they are stiff (see page 525). Add the sifted sugar very
slowly ½ teaspoonful at a time. Beat the eggs constantly. Continue to
beat for several minutes after the last of the sugar has been added.
Add:

     1 teaspoon vanilla

Fold in:

     ¾ cup sugar

Place large spoonfuls of this mixture on a baking sheet or shape the
meringues with a pastry bag into ovals. Bake them in a very slow oven
225° from 45 to 60 minutes. Remove them from the sheet. If they are to
be filled (this is optional) crush the smooth side with the thumb while
the meringues are warm. Shortly before serving the meringues fill the
hollows with:

       Sweetened and flavored whipped cream or a frozen mixture

Place two filled meringues together. Serve them with:

       Sweetened crushed fruit, Chocolate Sauce (page 673), or
       Butterscotch Sauce (page 673)

                 *        *        *        *        *

                      MERINGUE TART (“PINCH PIE”)

6 Servings

While the preceding meringue mixture may be shaped into a tart this rule
is so much better for the purpose that it is advisable to follow it.
This is a sure-fire hit as a dessert. It deserves all the asterisks in
the printing press. I never serve it to strangers without sending them
home happy, replete and with the recipe in their pockets.

Sift:

     1 cup sugar

Place on a platter:

     3 egg whites
     ½ teaspoon any baking powder
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Combine in a small pitcher or cup:

     1 teaspoon vanilla
     1 teaspoon vinegar
     1 teaspoon water

Whip the egg whites until they are stiff. Add the sifted sugar very
slowly ½ teaspoonful at a time, alternately with a few drops of the
combined liquids. Beat constantly. When all the ingredients have been
added continue to beat the meringue for several minutes. Heap it upon
the lightly greased platter or dish from which it is to be served.[1]
Subsequent baking will not affect the platter or dish. Shape the
meringue like a pie or tart with a heavy edge, using a spatula or knife.
Bake it in a very slow oven 275° for 1 hour or longer. When ready to
serve the meringue fill the center with:

       Sweetened fresh or stewed fruit[2]

Top it with lightly sweetened and flavored:

       Whipped cream

When making meringue tart with an electrical beater combine all the
ingredients except the sugar. Use high speed. When the egg whites are
stiff add the sugar, a tablespoonful at a time.

[2] Combinations of fruit are good for this purpose. Fresh strawberries
or raspberries and sliced bananas, or canned peaches or apricots,
pineapple and bananas.

The tart is delicious filled with orange or pineapple ice topped with
whipped cream.

     4 beaten egg yolks
     ½ cup sugar
       Juice and rind of 1 lemon
     1 tablespoon flour
     ½ cup water

Stir and cook the filling until it is thick. Cool it. When the pie and
the {pg 579}filling are cool, whip:

     1 cup heavy cream

Fold in:

     ½ teaspoon vanilla

Place a layer of cream in the pie, then the filling, then another layer
of cream. Chill the pie for several hours.

                               CREAM TART

The following recipe deserves a chapter to itself. It serves from eight
to ten people, is delicate and delicious and is not at all difficult to
make. The result is an optical as well as a gastronomic treat. It is a
de luxe dessert complete in itself and comparatively inexpensive. The
cake batter and the meringue are baked at the same time.

Blanch and shred:

     ⅓ cup almonds (optional)

Sift:

    1½ cups sugar

Beat until soft:

     ¼ cup butter

Add ½ cup of the sifted sugar gradually. Blend these ingredients until
they are light and creamy. Beat in, one at a time:

     4 egg yolks

Add:

     ½ teaspoon vanilla

Sift before measuring:

     1 cup cake flour

Resift with:

     2 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 1 teaspoon
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)
     ¼ teaspoon salt

Add the sifted ingredients to the butter mixture alternately with:

     5 tablespoons cream

Beat the batter until it is smooth. Spread it in two greased 9 inch
layer pans. Cover it with the following meringue. Whip until stiff:

     4 egg whites
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Add the remaining sifted sugar (1 cupful) very slowly—½ teaspoonful at
a time. Beat constantly. When all the sugar has been added continue to
beat for several minutes. Fold in:

     1 teaspoon vanilla

Spread the meringue lightly over the cake batter in both pans. Stud one
meringue with the blanched and shredded almonds, placing the shreds very
close together. Bake the layers in a slow oven 325° for 25 minutes.
Increase the heat to 350° and bake the cake 30 minutes longer. Remove
the layers from the oven. Permit the cakes to cool in the pans. Shortly
before serving the cake place one layer, meringue side down, on a cake
plate. Spread one of the following cream fillings over it, reserving 4
tablespoonfuls for the top. Place the almond studded layer, meringue
side up, on the cream filling and place the reserved filling in the
center on top.

                              BABA AU RHUM

Beloved by the French, who frequently serve it with tea. This is an
American version.

Prepare:

       High Coffee Cake (page 555) or Brioche Dough (page 466)

Make only ½ of the amount given for the latter. Place it in a greased 8
inch tube pan. Permit it to rise and bake it as directed. Remove it from
the pan, cool it and return it to the pan. Prepare a sirup by boiling
for 10 minutes:

     ½ cup water
     1 cup sugar

Cool the sirup slightly. Flavor it generously with:

       Rum or whisky (at least ¼ cup)

Place the sirup in a small pitcher. One hour before serving the Baba
pour the sirup slowly drop by drop onto the cake. Use as much as it will
absorb. Permit the Baba to stand until ready to serve. Remove it from
the pan. If it is to be a dessert top it with:

       Whipped cream

You may serve individual Baba cakes. Bake them in muffin tins. Soak them

                           RULE FOR CUP CAKES

Cup cakes are both easy to bake and to serve. They may be baked in
well-greased muffin tins filled two-thirds full, but a more attractive
way to make them is to fill paper baking cups about one-third full and
bake them on a sheet or in muffin pans in the oven. When the cakes are
done they will have risen to within a quarter of an inch of the frilled
edge. Cup cakes may be sprinkled with confectioner’s sugar after baking,
or they may be iced with butter icing or boiled icing and garnished with
half a nut meat, three almonds, a cherry, raisins, etc. The recipes
given for layer and loaf cakes may be used for cup cakes successfully,
except the rules for sponge and angel cakes. See the rule for Filled Cup
Cakes (page 586). They are delicious.

                            Squares and Bars

The most quickly made of all small cakes. The following batters are
baked in shallow pans. Sometimes the cakes are iced; sometimes they are
rolled in confectioner’s sugar; but as a rule they merely are cut into
shapes and served.

                       BROWNIES I (FUDGE SQUARES)

About 48 one by two inch bars

“Than which there are no others.”

Sift:

     2 cups sugar

Melt, then cool:

     4 ounces chocolate
     ½ cup butter

Beat until light:

Add the sifted sugar gradually. Continue to beat until these ingredients
are light and creamy. Fold in the melted mixture and:

     1 teaspoon vanilla

Sift and add:

     1 cup bread flour

Beat the batter until it is smooth. Fold in:

ingredients until they are creamy. Beat in the remaining egg. Melt, then
cool and add:

     2 ounces chocolate

Stir in:

    3½ tablespoons bread flour
     1 teaspoon vanilla

                                Cookies

                        RULE FOR ROLLING COOKIES

Avoid the use of flour if possible when rolling cooky dough. An easy way
is to roll it between sheets of waxed paper. This obviates the use of
flour on the board and on the roller. It is not necessary to roll cooky
{pg 591}dough. It may be patted with the palm of the hand. Chilled dough
may be handled more readily than warm dough.

To keep cookies from sticking to the pans spread the pans with beeswax.

Simple decorations add a great deal to the appearance (or disappearance)
of cookies. They may be cut into small attractive shapes. They may be
decorated before being baked with blanched almonds cut in halves, nut
meats, pieces of candied cherry, raisins, currants, fruit peel or a
sprinkling of sugar. You may make cookies glossy by spreading them,
before baking, with cream or evaporated milk. When the cookies are taken
from the oven they may be sprinkled with colored or chocolate candy
shot, or with colored sugar or they may be decorated with dabs of jelly.
They may be iced with chocolate, white or colored icing.

try out one or two cookies. If they are too dry, add a little more
marmalade; if they are too moist add a little more flour.

A number of cookbooks have much-vaunted recipes for these cookies. I
have tried many of them and find that they are all practically the same
as Butterscotch Brownies on page 587, only they are more troublesome and
as they call for more flour are not quite so good as that chewy,
flavorful mouthful. Please try out the Brownies and see for yourself,
then if you still persist in wanting a drop cookie instead of a bar,
just follow the recipe and add 2 tablespoonfuls of flour.

The three following recipes for nut wafers are delicious. They are not

                           MACAROON JAM TARTS

The star of stars. Quite the best I know how to make. This macaroon tart
calls for two kinds of cake—a rich cooky as a base and an almond
macaroon as a topping. Add to this thick, good jam—strawberry or
plum—and you have as delicious a combination as can be found.

Sift:

     ¼ cup sugar

Beat until soft:

     1 cup butter

Add the sugar gradually. Blend these ingredients until they are creamy.
Beat in:

     2 egg yolks

     3 tablespoons lemon juice

Add gradually:

     3 cups sifted bread flour

alternately with:

     ¼ cup cold water

When these ingredients are well blended cover them and place them in the
refrigerator for 12 hours. Roll out the dough to the thickness of ⅛
inch. Cut it into large rounds (about 2½ inches in diameter). Chill them
(optional).

Whip until stiff:

     3 egg whites

Beat in gradually:

    1⅓ cups confectioner’s sugar
     1 teaspoon vanilla

Fold in:

     ½ pound almonds, blanched and ground in a nut grinder

Place this mixture around the edge of each cooky, making a border ¾ inch
wide. To do this use a pastry bag, a spatula or a spoon. Bake the cakes
in a moderate oven 350° until they are done. When they are cold fill the
centers with:

depression {pg 603}in each ball. Place in the depression a bit of:

       Drained strawberry preserves
     ½ pecan meat

     2 tablespoons milk
     ½ teaspoon vanilla
     ¼ teaspoon almond extract

Sift before measuring:

    1⅓ cups bread flour

Resift with:

     1 teaspoon any baking powder
     ½ teaspoon salt

Add the sifted ingredients to the butter mixture. Beat the batter until
it is smooth. Grease the bottom of an inverted dripping pan or a baking
sheet. Spread the batter evenly—to the depth of ⅛ inch—over the pan
with a spatula. Sprinkle the dough with:

     ⅓ cup chopped nut meats

Bake it in a moderate oven 375° for about 12 minutes. Cut the cake into
¾ by 4 inch strips. Shape them while hot over a rolling pin. If the
strips become too brittle before they are shaped, return them to the
oven until they become pliable again.

                         PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES

After many try-outs I find these the only peanut butter cookies that are
really good—perhaps I do not know all the recipes extant, but I have
struggled with many. This recipe makes about 60 one and a half inch
cookies. They are rich and crumbly.

Sift:

     ½ cup brown sugar
     ½ cup granulated sugar

Beat until soft:

     ½ cup butter

Add the sugar gradually and blend these ingredients until they are
creamy. Beat in:

     1 egg
     1 cup peanut butter
     ½ teaspoon salt
     ½ teaspoon soda

Sift before measuring:

    1½ cups bread flour

Add the flour to the batter and:

     ½ teaspoon vanilla

Roll the dough into small balls. Place them on a greased tin. Press them
flat with a fork. Bake them in a moderate oven 375° for about 15
minutes.

Sift:

     ⅓ cup confectioner’s sugar

Beat until thick and lemon colored:

     1 whole egg
     2 egg yolks

Sift before measuring:

     ⅓ cup cake flour

Resift it three times. Whip until stiff but not dry:

     2 egg whites
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Fold the sugar gradually into the egg whites. Beat the mixture until it
thickens again. Fold in the egg yolk mixture and:

     ¼ teaspoon vanilla

Fold in the flour. Shape the dough into oblongs on ungreased paper
placed in a pan, or pour it into greased lady finger or small muffin
tins. Bake the cakes in a moderate oven 375° for about 12 minutes.


                          Cooky Press Cookies

A number of cooky doughs may be put through a cooky press. All the
Icebox Cookies and many others may be made into these attractive little
cakes. The press seems to call for a rather firm dough. If the dough you
wish to use does not do well in the press, try chilling it until it is
ready to be used successfully.


                             Icebox Cookies

The following recipes for Icebox Cookies are all so good that it is hard
to decide upon the best. The addition of nut meats, which is optional,
is considered an improvement to the plain cooky, but the cooky au
naturel is mighty good.

                        RULE FOR ICEBOX COOKIES

Combine the ingredients as directed and shape the dough into long rolls
about two inches in diameter. If the dough is too soft to roll, chill it
until it can be handled easily. Do not use additional flour. Cover the
rolls with waxed paper and place them in the refrigerator for about
twenty-four hours (until they are thoroughly chilled). Cut the rolls
into the thinnest possible slices. Bake them on a greased sheet in an
oven heated to 400° for about ten minutes. The whole nut meats may be
combined with the dough or they may be used to garnish the slices.

For Meringue Tart (“Pinch Pie”), see page 578.

                        RULE FOR MERINGUE KISSES

Meringue cakes or kisses are made with egg whites, sugar and other
ingredients. A small quantity of salt is added to the egg whites and
they are whipped on a platter with a flat wire egg beater until they are
stiff and hold a peak, but not until they are dry. The sugar is then
added very slowly during continuous beating. When the last of the sugar
has been blended thoroughly, the remaining ingredients are folded in.
The batter is dropped from a spoon onto a lightly greased tin or onto
waxed paper and shaped into cones. The kisses are baked in a very slow
oven 225° until they are partly dry and will retain their shape. They
are removed from the pan while hot.

                            Christmas Cakes

The following are various forms of German Christmas Cakes. They are so
good that one wonders why they are limited to one short period of the
year. If the cakes become hard keep an apple in the cooky jar.

                           GERMAN HONEY CAKES

Honey, like molasses, is apt to be troublesome. Old German cooks used to
insist on its being over a year old. Very good cakes are made with fresh
honey but then the amount of flour is a little hard to gauge. These
cakes will keep for six months and longer if placed in a closed tin.

Heat slightly in a large saucepan:

     6 pounds honey or molasses

Add and melt:

     1 cup butter

Sift and add sufficient:

       Bread flour

to make a semi-liquid dough. Add:

     1 pound almonds, blanched and shredded
     ½ pound chopped citron
     4 cups sugar
     6 tablespoons mixed spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, allspice)
     4 teaspoons grated lemon rind

When the dough is nearly cold add:

     1 ounce carbonate of powdered ammonia dissolved in ½ cup water, wine
       or rum

Sift and add sufficient:

       Bread flour

to make a dough that will stick to the hands. The dough may be baked at
once, but the cakes are better when the dough has been aged. It will
keep for weeks in a cool place. Roll out the dough or pat it (it may be
necessary to warm it) and spread it to the thickness of ¼ inch in
shallow greased pans. In doing this use as little flour as possible or
roll the dough between sheets of waxed paper. Bake it in a moderate oven
350°. Cut the cake into squares and ice them with the following icing:

Lemon Icing

Whip until stiff:

     2 egg whites
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Sift and add sufficient:

       Confectioner’s sugar and grated rind and juice of
     1 lemon

to make the icing a good consistency to spread.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                     GERMAN HONEY CAKES with EGGS I

Cut into small pieces and combine:

     3 ounces citron
     3 ounces candied orange peel
     3 ounces candied lemon peel

Add:

     1 cup chopped blanched almonds
     1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
     3 tablespoons cinnamon
     1 tablespoon cloves
    3⅓ cups confectioner’s sugar

Beat until light and add:

     6 eggs

Bring to the boiling point, then cool until lukewarm:

     1 pint honey

Dissolve:

     1 tablespoon soda

in:

     2 tablespoons hot water

Add this to the egg mixture with the honey and:

     ¼ cup orange juice

Sift and stir in:

     5 cups bread flour

Permit the dough to stand for 12 hours or more. Drop it from a spoon,
well apart, on a greased baking sheet. Bake the cakes in a moderate oven
{pg 608}350°. When they are cool decorate the cakes with:

       Icing for Christmas Cakes, (page 623)

Decorate them before baking with:

       Blanched almonds

                 *        *        *        *        *

                    GERMAN HONEY CAKES with EGGS II

These are more lightly spiced than Honey Cakes with Eggs I. They are
very delicate.

Blanch and shred:

     1 pound almonds

Chop:

     ¼ pound citron

Sift:

     4 cups bread flour

Resift with:

     1 teaspoon cinnamon
     1 teaspoon cloves
     ½ teaspoon nutmeg
     ¼ teaspoon allspice

Dissolve:

     1 teaspoon carbonate of powdered ammonia

in:

     ¼ cup brandy

Boil:

     1 quart honey

Cool it slightly. Stir in part of the flour. Beat in one at a time:

     4 eggs

Stir in the brandy, almonds, citron and the rest of the flour. Chill the
dough for 12 hours. Drop it from a spoon, well apart onto a greased
baking sheet. Honey is a difficult ingredient. Sometimes it “acts up.”
It may become necessary to use more flour in the dough. Bake it in a
moderate oven 350°. Ice it with:

       Icing for Christmas Cakes, (page 623)

              CHRISTMAS CAKES with MOLASSES and CHOCOLATE

The chocolate does not predominate in these cakes. Their marvelously
blended flavor makes them Christmas cakes par excellence.

Sift:

    1½ cups sugar

Beat until soft:

     ¼ cup butter

Add the sugar gradually. Blend these ingredients until they are creamy.
Beat in, one at a time:

     9 eggs

Beat in:

     2 tablespoons whisky
     1 cup molasses
    2½ teaspoons cinnamon
     ½ teaspoon cloves
     ½ teaspoon allspice

Grate and add:

     2 ounces sweet chocolate
     1 cup chopped citron, orange or lemon rind (optional)

Stir in:

     2 cups broken pecan meats

Sift before measuring:

     3 cups bread flour

Resift with:

     3 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 2 teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447)

Stir the flour into the other ingredients. Spread the dough in two 9 x
13 inch pans lined with waxed paper. Bake the cakes in a moderate oven
350°. Do not permit them to become very dry. When slightly cooled cut
the cakes into shapes. Ice them with:

       Glaze for Christmas Cakes (page 623)

                 *        *        *        *        *

                        CHRISTMAS CHOCOLATE BARS

These differ very much from the preceding cakes for they are richly
flavored with chocolate. As it is difficult to choose between them,
better bake them both and ice one with white and the other with
chocolate icing. The question of preference is then up to the family.

Sift:

    2¾ cups (1 pound) brown sugar

Beat until light:

     6 small eggs or 5 large ones

Add the sugar gradually and beat these ingredients until they are well
blended. Grate and add:

     4 ounces chocolate

Combine and sift:

     3 cups bread flour
     1 tablespoon cinnamon
    1½ teaspoons cloves
     ½ teaspoon allspice
     1 teaspoon soda

Add the sifted ingredients to the egg mixture alternately with:

     ½ cup honey or molasses

Chop and add:

     1 cup citron

     1 cup sugar

Cream the sugar with:

     ¾ cup butter

This recipe is like the saxophone which belongs neither with the wood
winds nor with the brass. It is a kind of meringue but it is always
found among the Christmas cakes. By the way, the various forms of
Meringue Kisses (page 606) are very decorative in Christmas boxes.

Blanch:

     1 pound almonds

Cut them lengthwise into thin shreds. Toast them lightly. Whip until
stiff:

     7 egg whites

Add gradually, beating constantly:

    2⅔ cups (1 pound) confectioner’s sugar

My old recipe says stir for ½ hour, but of course you won’t do that, so
stir until you are tired. Fold in the almonds and:

     1 teaspoon vanilla

Sprinkle a board with:

       Confectioner’s sugar

Shape the batter into rings. Place them on a greased tin. Bake them in a

Add the sugar very slowly. Whip constantly. Combine and fold in:

     ½ teaspoon cornstarch
     ½ teaspoon any baking powder
     ½ pound almonds, blanched and ground in a nut grinder

Drop the batter from a teaspoon well apart onto a greased tin. Decorate
the centers of the cookies with:

This and the three following recipes are good rules for utilizing the
many yolks left over from baking Christmas nut cakes. In Germany the
dough of No. 1 is invariably used to form the letter S. I have used it
successfully for engagement parties—shaping the initials of the
bethrothed. The letters are very dainty. This amount makes about 250
letters. Don’t worry, they will all be eaten.

This recipe is for the well-known German Anise Cakes, which are made at
Christmastime and which are stamped with a wooden mold into quaint
little designs and figures. This calls for the same ingredients as the
preceding Anise Cakes recipe, but it is much heavier in flour. If these
cakes become too hard, keep an apple in the cooky jar.

Sift:

     2 cups sugar

Beat until light:

     4 eggs

Add the sugar gradually. Beat the ingredients until they are creamy.
Sift before measuring:

     4 cups bread flour (approximately)

(Add flour until the dough is stiff.) Roll it to the thickness of ¼
inch. Flour a springerle board. Press it hard upon the dough to get a
good imprint. Separate the squares, place them on a board and permit
them to dry for 12 hours. Butter tins and sprinkle them with:

     1 tablespoon crushed anise seed

Place the cakes on them. Bake them in a slow oven 300° until the lower
part is light yellow.


                        Icings and Cake Fillings


                             Boiled Icings

                          RULE FOR WHITE ICING

Boil the amount of water and sugar[1] given in the recipes until the
sirup forms a soft ball when dropped into cold water, or when it forms a
thread about three inches long when dropped from a spoon. This thread
should be thin enough to curl or wave. In either case the sirup will
have reached about 238 degrees of heat.

Add the salt to the egg whites. (Egg whites may be whipped until they
are stiff, whipped until they are frothy, or they need not be whipped at
all before the sirup is added.)

The sirup is poured upon them while it is very hot in a very fine
stream, the eggs being beaten constantly during the addition of the
sirup and afterward until the icing becomes creamy and of the right
consistency to spread.[2]

When the last of the sirup has been added one-eighth teaspoonful of
cream of tartar (to two egg whites) or a few drops of lemon juice may be
added to keep the icing from becoming gritty.

Beat in the flavoring as the icing cools.

When the sirup has been cooked to the right stage, the icing will spread
readily and will stay where it is put. If it has not been boiled long
enough and the icing does not thicken, beat it in strong sunlight or
near an open oven door, or place the bowl containing the icing over (not
in) boiling water and beat the icing until it becomes the right
consistency to spread. {pg 614}

If the sirup has been cooked too long and the icing threatens to harden
too soon, beat in a few drops of lemon juice or a teaspoon or more of
boiling water.

Have a bowl of very hot water in readiness before making a white icing.
You are then prepared for any emergency.

Never place a thin or doubtful icing on a cake. Do everything you can to
thicken it before taking this step.

When the icing begins to thicken around the sides of the bowl, it is
usually ready to be spread but, if you are in doubt about it, spread a
small quantity only and see how it behaves. A little patience at this
stage of the icing will save endless trouble and will insure a
good-looking cake.

Pile the icing on top of the cake and use a spatula or knife to spread
it. Spread it quickly, working it toward the edges and sides of the
cake. Dip the spatula in hot water as the icing thickens. Add a little
hot water, if necessary, to soften the last icing in the bowl.

If raisins, nut meats, or other ingredients are to be added to the
icing, wait until the last moment to do so. Acid or oil is apt to thin
the icing beyond repair if the fruit is added too soon.

When icing large or small cakes decorate them with nut meats, with
candied cherries, angelica, etc.

-----

[1] Add 1 tablespoonful corn sirup to every cup of sugar if you wish to
eliminate all danger of the icing becoming gritty.

[2] If you have any difficulty in keeping the bowl steady, place it on a
wet folded dish cloth.

       Raisin Smash Icing

Use only ½ cup chopped, seeded raisins and add:

     ½ cup chopped nut meats

                 *        *        *        *        *

                             COCOANUT ICING

If possible use fresh:

       Grated cocoanut[1]

(Canned or boxed cocoanut may be substituted.) Sprinkle it lightly over
the freshly spread:

       White Icing I (see above) or Seven Minute White Icing (page 618)

-----

[1] A little grated lemon or orange rind may be added to the grated
cocoanut for flavor.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                               NUT ICING

Just before spreading:

       White Icing I (see above) or Seven Minute White Icing (page 618)

Add:

     ¼ to ½ cup chopped nut meats

or sprinkle the nut meats over the freshly spread icing before it
hardens. {pg 615}

                 *        *        *        *        *

                   CHOCOLATE COATING over WHITE ICING

A very good touch to something that is good in itself.

Melt:

     2 ounces chocolate

Cool it and spread it with a broad knife or spatula over:

       White Icing I (see page 614) or Seven Minute White Icing (page 618)

This may be done as soon as the white icing is set. Allow several hours
for the coating to harden. In summer or moist weather add to the
chocolate before spreading it:

     ¼ teaspoon melted paraffin

This coating _will_ run. Transfer the cake to a fresh plate before
serving it. Do not attempt to make this coating in excessively hot
weather unless the cake can be put in an icebox until the chocolate
hardens.

                 *        *        *        *        *

                       CHOCOLATE PEPPERMINT ICING

Prepare:

       White Icing I (see page 614) or Seven Minute White Icing (page 618)

Before spreading it add:

       A few drops of peppermint extract

Cover it as directed in the preceding rule with:

       Chocolate Coating

                 *        *        *        *        *

           WHITE MOUNTAIN ICING (Made with an Electric Mixer)

Stir until the sugar is dissolved then cook covered until the sirup
boils rapidly:

     1 tablespoon white corn sirup
     1 cup sugar
     ⅓ cup water

Beat for about 2 minutes in a small bowl at high speed:

     1 egg white

Add 3 tablespoons of the boiling sirup. Continue to beat until the sirup
reaches the thread stage, 238°. Pour the remaining sirup gradually into
the egg mixture while continuing to beat at high speed. Add while
beating:

     1 teaspoon vanilla

Beat the icing until it is ready to spread (from 4 to 6 minutes).

                 *        *        *        *        *

                 DECORATIVE ICING (Twice Cooked Icing)

Sufficient to cover and decorate a round 9 inch cake about 4 inches high

This is a fine recipe for decorative icing. It will keep without
hardening for a long time if closely covered with waxed paper.

Stir until the sugar is dissolved then boil without stirring:

     1 cup sugar
     ½ cup water

Meanwhile whip until stiff:

     2 egg whites
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Sift and add very slowly, whipping constantly:

     3 tablespoons sugar

When the sirup begins to fall in heavy drops from a spoon add a small
quantity of it to the eggs and sugar and continue beating. Repeat this
process, adding the sirup to the eggs in 4 or 5 parts. If these
additions are properly timed the last of the sirup will have reached the
thread stage. Beat the icing constantly. Have a pan ready partly filled
with water. Place it over heat. The bowl in which the icing is being
made should fit closely into this pan so that the bowl will be _over_,
but not _in_ the water. When the water in the pan begins to boil add to
the icing:

     ¼ teaspoon icing powder (equal parts of baking powder and tartaric
       acid)

[Illustration]

Continue to beat the icing until it sticks to the sides and the bottom
of the bowl and holds a point. Remove the icing from the heat. Place as
much as is required for the decoration (usually about ⅓) in a small
bowl. Cover it closely with waxed paper. To the remainder add:

     1 teaspoon or more of hot water

to thin it to the right consistency to spread. Beat it well and spread
it on the cake. Decorate the cake with the reserved icing. Color it
with:

       Color paste

Have ready oblongs of baker’s paper that have been rolled into
cornucopia shaped bags, secured near the point with a pin. Flatten a bag
and cut a small piece from the point to make dots or stems. Cut it like
this diagram to make leaves or petals. Fill the bags with icing, close
them {pg 616}by doubling over the paper at the top and force the icing
through the point of the bag.

When it is done remove the icing from the fire, add the vanilla as
directed and fold in the melted chocolate. This should stiffen quickly.
If it does not, give it time before spreading it. Do not make the
mistake (I did) of trying to stiffen it by longer cooking after the
chocolate has been added.

                            Uncooked Icings

                        RULE FOR UNCOOKED ICINGS

Uncooked icings are very good and very quickly made. Their one drawback
is that they sometimes have a slightly raw taste.

By letting uncooked icings made with confectioner’s sugar stand over hot
water for 10 or 15 minutes this raw taste is overcome. Make the icing
soon after putting the cake in the oven. Let it stand over hot water
until you are ready to spread it. Beat it until it is cool and the right
consistency to spread easily. If a delicate flavoring (vanilla, rum,
sherry) is used, it is wise to add it after the icing is removed from
the hot water.

The following uncooked icings may be made with an electric mixer.
Combine the ingredients, using soft butter and only one-half the sugar.
Beat them at high speed from three to five minutes. Add the remaining
sugar gradually until the icing is a good consistency to spread.

                         Puddings and Desserts


Note. You will find a number of suggestions for fruit desserts in the
{pg 627}section on Fresh Fruits, Stewed and Baked, page 394.

Custard sauces and puddings are prepared over boiling water or over a
very low flame. They must be stirred constantly while they are cooking
and they must not be permitted to boil at any time. A high degree of
heat destroys their delicate flavor and solidifies the eggs too rapidly,
causing them to curdle or separate. Should a custard sauce separate,
remove it at once from the fire, dump it quickly into a cold bowl and
whip it with a spiral wire whisk. Beat it well and it may become smooth.
A spiral wire whisk (see page 377) is helpful when making custards and
pudding mixtures.

The rule for whipping cream, evaporated milk and egg whites and for
dissolving gelatine will be found on page 557.

_Rule for Puddings Made with an Electric Mixer:_

Whip egg whites at high speed.

Whip egg yolks at medium speed.

Whip gelatine mixtures that are nearly set at medium speed.

Whip cream at medium speed.

Whip snow pudding (and similar desserts) after all the ingredients are
combined at high speed until the mixture holds its shape.


                                Custards

A family I know had a colored cook who always urged the children to eat
sparingly of the meat course so as to leave a little room for the
“hereafter.” I have prepared so many, many “hereafters” for children and
grown-ups that I feel like Christopher Morley’s heroine, who made an
anthology of the loaves of bread she had baked.

The majority of the following recipes are simple, require only staple
articles and are very quickly made. {pg 628}

                              CUP CUSTARD

5 Servings

Scald:

     2 cups milk
     ¼ cup sugar
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Pour these ingredients slowly over:

     3 beaten egg yolks or 2 whole eggs

     ½ teaspoon vanilla
     ⅛ teaspoon nutmeg (optional)

Beat the custard until it is well blended. Pour it into a baking dish or
into individual molds. Place the molds in a pan of hot water in a
moderate oven 325° for about ¾ hour or until the custard is set. To
test, insert a silver knife or spoon. If the custard does not adhere to
the spoon it is ready to be removed from the oven. Chill and serve it
with:

       Caramel Sirup (page 671) or Fruit juice

                 *        *        *        *        *

                        CUSTARD with EGG WHITES

                           CARAMELIZED DISHES

To caramelize a mold, put one-half cup of sugar in it and place it over
heat. When the sugar is melted and brown, turn the mold so that the
caramel will spread—push it with a spoon until the entire surface of
the mold is covered, then pour a custard or pudding mixture into the
mold and follow the directions given for cooking the custard or pudding.
Invert the custard when it is cold.

                   “BOILED” CUSTARD or CUSTARD SAUCE

About 2½ cupfuls

This custard has acquired a celestial association thanks to the
incomparable _Green Pastures_. It is badly named as it must not be
permitted to boil at any time.

Beat slightly:

     3 or 4 egg yolks

Add:

     ¼ cup sugar
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

that it does not boil. (Or cook it over boiling water until it begins to
thicken.) Strain and cool the custard. Add to it:

     1 teaspoon vanilla, rum or sherry or a little grated lemon rind

Chill it thoroughly. This is not a firm custard. It is really a custard
sauce.

                                Tapioca

Java produces the cassava plant and the cassava root produces tapioca
but the commercial article as we know it is produced in the United
States. Quick cooking tapioca is rapidly taking the place of pearl
tapioca, but the latter remains a favorite with a great many people who
regret that it is almost obsolete. Pearl tapioca must be soaked for one
hour or more in water to cover. It is then drained, a liquid is added to
it and it is cooked in a double boiler until it is transparent. Quick
cooking tapioca requires no soaking but the subsequent process is the
same. Use twice as much pearl tapioca as quick cooking tapioca. When
tapioca puddings are sticky they have been cooked too long.

minutes. Stir and cook them 5 minutes longer. Remove them from the
steam. The tapioca thickens as it cools. Whip until stiff:

     ⅛ teaspoon salt

Fold a small amount of the tapioca into the egg white, then fold the egg
white into the rest of the tapioca. Fold in:

     1 teaspoon vanilla or 1 teaspoon orange or lemon rind

Chill the pudding. Serve it with:

                      BREAD PUDDING with MERINGUE

6 Servings

Well-made bread pudding is an excellent dish, particularly if one is
clever about “jazzing up” the hard sauce that accompanies it.

Cut bread into slices and trim away the crusts. Soak for 15 minutes:

     5 cups diced fresh bread or 3⅓ cups stale bread[1]

in:

     3 cups warm milk

Add:

     ¼ teaspoon salt

Combine and beat well:

     3 egg yolks
     ⅓ to ½ cup sugar
     1 teaspoon vanilla
     ½ teaspoon nutmeg (optional)

Add:

     ¼ cup raisins or nut meats (optional)

Pour these ingredients over the soaked bread. Stir them lightly with a
fork until they are well blended.[2] Place them in a baking dish set in
a pan of hot water in a moderate oven 350° for about ¾ hour. Cool the
pudding. Cover it with a Meringue (page 510) made with:

     3 egg whites
     ⅛ teaspoon salt
     6 tablespoons sugar
     ½ teaspoon vanilla

Bake the pudding in a slow oven 300° until the meringue is set (for
about 15 minutes). Serve it hot with:

       Hard Sauce (page 670), Strawberry Hard Sauce II (page 671) or cream
       or fruit juice

A layer of:

       Jelly or stewed fruit, drained

may be placed between the pudding and the meringue. In that case the
pudding is good served with cream.

You may vary the flavor of bread pudding by adding: ½ cupful of dates,
figs, bananas or some orange marmalade.

-----

[1] The bread should be measured lightly, not packed.

[2] If preferred the meringue may be dispensed with. Whip the egg whites
until they are stiff and fold them in at this time.

A friend writes: “Here is something we like and maybe it is new to you.
When making your Cottage {pg 642}Pudding I put peaches or plums after
they have been halved on top of the unbaked dough, then put a
teaspoonful of sugar in the hollow of the fruit that is facing up and
push the whole thing gently in the dough. The dough will rise up around
it, the sugar melts in the hollow making a sweet sirup that sweetens the
fruit. Looks and tastes nice.”

It may be helpful to read the rules given on page 217 for combining and
baking soufflés. The cook who has mastered the very simple art of making
soufflés has added an exceedingly convenient and palatable dish to her
list of economical desserts.

A soufflé is usually baked in a moderate oven until firm, but a good
result may be obtained by steaming it in a greased 2 quart double boiler
over (not in) boiling water for about three-quarters of an hour. Invert
the soufflé onto a plate.

     1 teaspoon vanilla

Whip until stiff:

     3 egg whites
     ⅛ teaspoon salt

                            Steamed Puddings

                       RULE FOR STEAMING PUDDINGS

Place the pudding mixture in a well-greased pudding mold, in individual
cups made for this purpose or in a tin receptacle having a tightly
fitted lid. (A baking powder can may be used.) Fill the mold or molds
{pg 650}two-thirds full. Place the receptacle in a steamer over boiling
water, or place it on a rack in a kettle of boiling water. Keep the
water boiling and do not jar the kettle. Do not permit the water to
diminish to any great extent. Add boiling water so that more than
one-half of the mold is immersed all the time. This will insure a light,
well-cooked pudding. This is the ideal way to prepare steamed puddings.
Pudding mixtures may be steamed in a greased, covered double boiler with
good results. They may also be placed in greased custard cups (covered
by heavy waxed paper held in place by rubber bands) and steamed in a pan
of hot water in a moderate oven 350° or on top of the stove.

-----

[1] These proportions of water, fruit juice and wine may be varied. If
the wine is not strong, use less water to dissolve the gelatine and
increase the amount of wine accordingly. This makes a soft jelly of a
very good consistency to serve in sherbet glasses or from a bowl. If a
stiff jelly is desired for molds, increase the gelatine to 3
tablespoonfuls.

[2] It is difficult to give an accurate sugar measurement. One-half
cupful is sufficient if both the oranges and the wine are sweet. Taste
the combined ingredients and stir in additional sugar if it is needed.

                    Sauces for Puddings and Desserts

Rum, sherry, brandy, Madeira, etc., add flavor and piquancy to desserts
and sauces. Be very careful to vary all flavors as the same flavor
should not be repeated too frequently.

Plain custard sauce, cream or fruit juice are excellent if served with
the right pudding at the right time. With pudding sauces the “object all
sublime” is “to let the punishment fit the crime.” A sauce should
complement a pudding. If a pudding is acid, serve a bland sauce; if a
pudding is bland, serve a sauce with character; and if a pudding is
rich, shun whipped cream and try a fruit sauce. The success of the
pudding with sauce will depend upon your sense of discrimination.

        Ice Creams and Ices to be Frozen in an Ice Cream Freezer

            RULE FOR MAKING ICE CREAM AND ICES IN A FREEZER

Use cream that is twenty-four hours old, as it makes a finer grain than
fresh cream. When it is possible to do so, dissolve the sugar in liquid
over heat before adding it to the cream.

Add one-eighth teaspoonful, or more, of salt to the sirup. Cool the
sirup before adding it to the cream. Chill the mixture to be frozen
before placing it in the ice cream container.

Fill the ice cream container only three-fourths full to allow for the
expansion of the frozen cream.

Allow from three to six measures of ice to one measure of coarse (rock)
salt, according to the rapidity with which you wish to freeze the cream.
The larger proportion of salt will bring quicker results, but the cream
is finer grained when it is frozen slowly. Pack the freezer one-third
full of ice before adding any salt, then add the salt and the remaining
ice and salt in alternate layers around the container until the freezer
is filled.

Turn the cream slowly at first until a slight pull is felt, then turn it
rapidly.

If the ice cream is to be used at once, turn it until it is very stiff.
If the ice cream is to be packed, turn it only until it is the
consistency of thick sauce.

Pour off the salt water in the freezer. Wipe the lid carefully, remove
it, remove the dasher, scrape it and pack the cream down with a spoon.
Place a heavy piece of waxed paper over the top of the container. Place
a cork in the lid, fit it closely on the container and repack the ice

 Ice Creams, Ices and Desserts to Be Frozen in Refrigerator Trays or in
                                 Molds

                 RULES FOR MAKING FROZEN DESSERTS WITH
                        MECHANICAL REFRIGERATION

In order to freeze ices and ice creams successfully in a mechanical
refrigerator, or in a mold packed in ice and salt, it is advisable to
add some thickening substance to the mixture to be frozen. This
substance may be dissolved gelatine, flour or cornstarch, egg yolks in
custard or hot sirup poured over egg yolks or egg whites.

When cream or evaporated milk is used in creams or mousses it must be
stiffly whipped and folded into the other ingredients just before the
mixture is put into a refrigerator tray or mold.

Mechanically frozen ice creams and ices have not the light consistency
characteristic of churned ice creams and ices, but in the case of
mousses and bombes, excellent results are obtained.

In the case of ices and sherbets vigorous beating at intervals during
the freezing time will give the ice the quality of a frappé (coarsely
frozen water ice).

Corn sirup added to water ice, ice cream or mousse, helps to prevent an
icy consistency—a good proportion being one part corn sirup to two
parts sugar.

Combinations that are too sweet will not freeze in a mechanical
refrigerator. A good proportion is one part sugar to four parts liquid.

Sherbets are water ices to which a small amount of dissolved gelatine is
added. When partly frozen the ice is combined with stiffly beaten egg
whites.

Parfaits are stiffly beaten egg whites over which a thick hot sirup is
poured. When the mixture is cool it is combined with stiffly whipped
cream.

Mousses are heavy cream whipped and combined with flavors of different
kinds, eggs, fruit pulp, chocolate, gelatine, macaroons, etc.

Bombes are mousses frozen into various shapes.

The length of time for freezing ices and ice creams depends upon the
refrigerator used. Companies manufacturing refrigerators issue time
charts for freezing desserts. The period varies but is usually from two
to four hours.

All mixtures frozen in refrigerator trays are improved by frequent
stirring while being frozen. They may be beaten with a wire whisk or an
electric beater shortly before being served.

=To Beat Cream:=

Place thoroughly chilled cream in a mixing bowl. Beat it with a
{pg 686}spiral wire whisk, or a rotary beater, until it begins to
stiffen. Be careful not to beat it too long, as it will turn to butter.

=To Beat Evaporated Milk:=

Place the milk in a double boiler. When it is scalded, add gelatine,
which has been soaked in cold water, and dissolve it well. Allow
one-half teaspoonful of gelatine soaked in two teaspoonfuls of cold
water to one and one-fourth cupfuls of scalded evaporated milk. Chill
the milk thoroughly, then beat it like cream.

=Rule for Sealing and Packing Molds:=

Molds fitted with tightly closing lids are made for freezing creams and
ices. If there is no mold available—a baking powder can, or other tin
receptacle that will close tightly, may be used.

Fill the mold with any desired mixture suited to the purpose of still
freezing, cover the top of the can with a piece of heavy waxed paper and
adjust the lid. Let the waxed paper protrude for an inch or more. Lift
the paper and spread a generous coating of lard around the container
under the paper, then plaster the paper down firmly and spread lard
around the edge of the lid. This will keep the salt water from
penetrating.

Have ice ready that has been pounded into small pieces, and set the mold
in a bed of ice. Allow from two to six portions of ice to one of salt,
and cover the mold completely. A bucket or pail is best that will allow
for about a three inch packing. Freeze the cream from four to six hours.

The three following bombes, or mousses, are old treasured family
recipes. These mixtures were placed in molds, packed in ice and salt and
served on “occasions.”

Today similar recipes are to be found in any book on Iceless
Refrigeration. Modern equipment has made these dishes commonplace, but
for me they retain a certain glamour associated with distinguished
company, conviviality and the easy flow of intellectual conversation.

                Jellies, Jams, Preserves and Marmalades


Jellies, jams and marmalades are made by boiling fruit juice and sugar,
or fruit and sugar, until these ingredients reach a stage when they will
form a jelly.

                    RULE FOR MAKING JELLY, JAM, ETC.

_Fruit:_

The best results are obtained by using fruit that is slightly underripe,
when its pectin content is highest. Fruit that is ripe or overripe does
not form a jelly readily. Slightly underripe fruit and fully ripened
fruit make a good combination as the latter is full flavored.

Some fruits contain so little pectin (raspberries, pineapple, cherries,
strawberries), that the addition of another fruit rich in pectin is
needed to make their juices thicken. Apples, crabapples, currants,
grapes, gooseberries, plums and cranberries are added measure for
measure to the fruits lacking the necessary amount of pectin.

Commercially prepared pectin is on sale at all groceries, and is in
favor with many people. No recipes for jellies and jams made with
commercially prepared pectin are given, as special instructions
invariably accompany the purchase of this product.

_Water:_

Water is added to fruit in varying quantities. Strawberries and some
other berries may be preserved without the addition of water. Apples,
plums and pears require it.

Water may be added to fruit until it can be seen through the top layer,
but the fruit must never float in water.

_Juice for Jelly:_

When the fruit has been cooked until it is soft, extract the juice by
putting it through a jelly bag. If the jelly is to be clear and
sparkling do not squeeze the bag.

Special racks are sold for jelly making—a bag accompanying them. If
there is no available jelly rack and bag, make a jelly bag of a material
that is heavy enough to hold back the particles that will cause the
jelly to be cloudy. The bag may be of flannel, or heavy muslin, or three
or four layers of cheesecloth. Sew the bag well so that it will be
strong. {pg 700}The top may be bound with tape and loops of tape may be
sewed to it from which to hang it, or, instead of hanging the bag, place
it on a strainer and permit the juice to drip through it. When the juice
stops dripping from the bag, you may return the pulp in the bag to the
kettle. Add about the same amount of water and boil it from 10 to 15
minutes. This second extraction will give you a second-grade
jelly—acceptable but inferior to the jelly made with the first
extraction.

After using the bag rinse it in boiling water.

The strained juice may be reheated, poured boiling hot into sterilized
jars, and covered tightly with screw tops. It will keep indefinitely and
can be made into jelly at your convenience.

_Sugar:_

Use three-fourths cupful of sugar to every cupful of juice or fruit,
except in cases where the fruit is extremely acid. Then use one cup of
sugar to one cup of fruit or juice. The sugar may be preheated by being
placed in a slow oven. Many cooks recommend this.

A jelly that contains too little sugar will not thicken, but a jelly
that contains too much sugar will become sirupy and will not thicken
either. The following helpful test has been contributed by the wife of
an instructor in physics.

_Test for Pectin:_

To determine if fruit juice contains sufficient pectin to jelly, take
one tablespoonful of the cooled fruit juice, add the same quantity of
grain alcohol and shake gently. The effect of the alcohol is to bring
together the pectin in a jelly—likewise, if a large quantity of pectin
is present it will appear in one mass or clot when poured from the
glass. This indicates that equal quantities of sugar and juice should be
used. If the pectin does not slip from the glass in one mass, less sugar
will be required. If the pectin collects in two or three masses, use
two-thirds or three-fourths as much sugar as juice. If it collects in
several small particles, use one-half as much sugar as juice.

_To Boil Jelly:_

The best jelly is made by cooking a small quantity of juice at a
time—from four to six cups. Measure the juice and place it in a deep
kettle that will allow for the boiling up of the liquid.

Boil the juice rapidly for five minutes and skim it, if necessary. Add
the sugar, stir it until it is dissolved, and continue to boil the juice
rapidly, without stirring it, until it is ready to be removed from the
fire.

_To Test Jelly:_

Begin to test the juice five minutes after the sugar has been added.
Place a small amount of jelly in a spoon, cool it slightly and let it
drop back into the pan from the side of the spoon. As the sirup
thickens, two large drops will form along the edge of the spoon, one on
either side. When these two drops come together and fall as one drop the
“sheeting stage” has been reached—220° to 222°.

This makes a firm jelly. If you like a somewhat softer jelly cook the
sirup until it falls in two heavy drops from the spoon but not until the
two side drops fall together and become one.

The jelly is then ready to be taken from the fire. The time for cooking
required will probably be between twelve and twenty minutes, dependent
upon the kind of fruit and the amount of sugar used. {pg 701}

Place the jelly at once in sterilized glasses. Fill them to within ¼
inch of top.

Do not boil jelly unnecessarily. Quick, short cooking preserves both its
color and its flavor.

_To Sterilize Glasses or Jars:_

Fill glasses or jars three-fourths full of water and place them well
apart in a shallow pan partly filled with water. Heat them in the oven
until the water simmers. If the lids are placed lightly upon the glasses
they will be sterilized at the same time.

_Paraffin:_

Melt paraffin over a very low flame or over hot water.[1] Pour it from a
small teapot or pitcher. (If the paraffin is permitted to become very
hot it is apt to pull away from the sides of the jelly glass.) Cover the
jelly as soon as it is cold with a very thin coating of paraffin. On the
second day cover the jelly again with a thin film of paraffin, tilting
the glass to permit the paraffin to cover every bit of the surface. The
two coatings should not be more than one-eighth inch thick. A heavy
coating of paraffin is apt to pull away from the sides of the glass.
Besides it is wasteful and unsightly.

-----

[1] A new way of handling paraffin is to put 1½ to 2 teaspoonfuls of
shaved paraffin in the bottom of a jelly glass. Pour the hot jelly on
it. The paraffin will melt and rise. In the case of preserves place the
paraffin in the hot sirup on top.

Cover the jelly glasses with tin lids and store the jelly in a cool,
dark place. If placed in a warm, light place, it may “weep”—ooze from
the glass.

_Preserves:_

Preserves are fruits cooked with sugar until the sirup thickens—the
fruit being permitted to remain whole.

Apply the test given for jelly. If you like a “loose” quality in
preserves, cook them until two heavy drops form on the edge of the spoon
and not until the two drops combine and fall together.

_Jams:_

Jam is fruit cooked with sugar until the ingredients thicken and the
fruit loses its shape.

Wash:

       Currants

It is not necessary to stem them. Place them in a kettle. Currants may
be cooked with or without water. (This is a matter of taste.) Cooking
them without water makes a very concentrated jelly. If water is used
allow about ¼ as much water as there is fruit. If no water is used crush
the bottom layer of currants and pile the rest on top of them. Cook the
currants until they are soft and colorless. Drain them through a jelly
bag (page 699). Allow to each cupful of juice:

     ¾ to 1 cup sugar

Cook only 4 cupfuls of juice at a time. Follow the Rule for Making Jelly
on page 699.

Add them to the currants. Cook the {pg 702}fruit until the currants are
soft and colorless. Strain the fruit through a jelly bag (page 699).
Equal parts of raspberries and currants may be used, or 2 parts
raspberries to 3 parts currants, and even 1 part raspberries to 3 parts
currants will impart a delicious flavor to the jelly. Allow to each
cupful of juice:

The following is a marvelous blend and sometimes blends are desirable.

Place as much sugar as you have strawberries in a porcelain lined dish
and soak them for 12 hours. Bring them quickly to the boiling point and
boil them with as little stirring as possible until the juice thickens
(for about 15 minutes). As strawberries are apt to come a little in
advance of the other fruits these preserves may be placed in fruit jars

The first four fruits are best used in equal proportions but
gooseberries have so much character that it is well to use a somewhat
smaller amount or their flavor will predominate. Bring the fruits
separately or together to the boiling point. Add to each cupful of fruit
and juice:

     ¾ cup sugar

Boil the jam until it is thick (for about 20 minutes). Combine it with
the strawberry preserves.

                              FRUIT BUTTER

A purée of fruit, sweetened, well spiced and cooked until thick.

Cut the fruit—apples, peaches or pears—into quarters, or prepare for
cooking grapes, plums or tomatoes. Stew the fruit slowly in a little
water or cider vinegar until it is soft. Put it through a sieve. Measure
it. Add to each cup of pulp: ⅓ to ⅔ cup sugar. Add grated lemon rind and
juice, cinnamon, cloves and allspice to taste. Whole spices may be used
to keep the butter from becoming dark. Put them in a bag and remove it
later. Cook the pulp, stirring it constantly[1] toward the end until it
sheets from a spoon. The residue in a jelly bag, after it has stopped
dripping, may be made into fruit butter. Add a small amount of water.
Boil it for 5 or 10 minutes. Put the pulp through a sieve and proceed as
directed for fruit butter.

[1] The question of how to cook apple butter is a moot point. Some cooks
cook it very slowly, others prefer a quick heat. How the stuff spits! It
always conjures up childhood visions of a brisk autumn day, a kettle
hung from a tripod in the yard and be-aproned women bustling about
taking turns at stirring the pot. This was usually an all-day
get-together that exhausted everybody concerned, but the result was
worth the effort.

     4 pounds apples

Remove the stems, quarter the apples. Cook them slowly until soft in:

     2 cups water or cider vinegar

Put the fruit through a strainer. Add to each cup of pulp:

     ½ cup sugar

Add:

     2 teaspoons cinnamon
     1 teaspoon cloves
     ½ teaspoons allspice
       Grated lemon rind and juice (optional)

                       PAULA’S BAKED APPLE BUTTER

A revolutionary rule given by a superb cook.

Wash and remove cores from: {pg 707}

    12 pounds apples (Jonathan or Winesap)

Cut them into quarters. Nearly cover them with water. Cook them gently
for about 1½ hours. Put the pulp through a fine strainer. Measure it.
Allow to each cup of pulp:

     ½ cup sugar

Add:

       Grated rind and juice of 2 lemons
     3 teaspoons cinnamon
    1½ teaspoons cloves
     ½ teaspoon allspice

Bring these ingredients to the boiling point. Chill them. Stir into
them:

     1 cup port, claret or dry white wine

Place about ¾ of the purée in fruit jars or in a large crock. Keep the
rest in reserve. Put the jars in a cold oven. Light the oven and set the
regulator at 300°. Permit the apple butter to bake until it thickens. As
the purée shrinks, fill the jars with the reserved apple butter. When
the apple butter is thick, but still moist, seal the jars.

The following conserve—a tradition in our family—is unusually good
served with a meat course or as a sauce over puddings and ices. {pg 710}

Place in a stone crock with a lid:

     1 quart brandy

Add, as they come into season, about:

     1 quart strawberries
     1 quart cherries
     1 quart raspberries
     1 quart currants
     1 quart gooseberries
     1 quart peeled and sliced apricots
     1 quart peeled and sliced peaches
     1 quart peeled and sliced pineapple, etc.

With each addition of fruit add the same amount of:

       Sugar

Stir the tutti frutti every day until the last of the fruit has been
added. Cover the crock well. Place it in a cool place. The mixture will
keep indefinitely. These are the clearest instructions I can give for
making it. Had I known, when I was permitted to go to the cellar as a
small child on tutti frutti stirring expeditions, that I should one day
write a cookbook I might have paid some attention to proportions. I am
told they are immaterial, which is fortunate, as I remember only the
excitement of the undertaking and the delicious aroma of the brew.

Brine is a solution of salt and water. Use one part common salt to
{pg 711}nine parts water. Combine the salt with a little water, dissolve
it and add the remaining water.

                             MUSTARD PICKLE

About 6 quarts

Since making the following mild and palatable pickle for the first time,
I have abandoned all other mixed pickles and have clung to this one as
it meets with general and enthusiastic approval.

Slice (unpeeled if tender):

     1 quart or more green cucumbers

Cover them for 12 hours with:

       Brine (see above rule)

Drain them well. Keep them separate. Slice to make 4 quarts with the
cucumbers:

       Green vegetables (green tomatoes, beans, etc.)

Keep them separate. Pour boiling salted water to cover (1 teaspoon salt
to 1 quart water) over the vegetables and bring them to the boiling
point. Drain them well. If the beans are not very young boil them until
they are nearly tender. Peel and slice:

     2 dozen small onions

Break into flowerets:

     1 large cauliflower

Slice:

     2 dozen or more small gherkins

Keep them separate. Pour boiling salted water over them. Bring them to
the boiling point. Drain them well. If the cauliflower is not very
tender boil it until it is partly done. Combine all the vegetables.
Prepare the following mustard sauce.

Combine and stir until smooth:

    1½ cups flour
     6 tablespoons dry mustard
    1½ tablespoons tumeric
     2 cups mild cider vinegar

Bring to the boiling point:

     2 quarts (8 cups) mild cider vinegar
    2½ cups sugar
     3 tablespoons celery seed

Slowly stir in the flour mixture. Stir constantly. When the sauce is
smooth and boiling combine it with the drained vegetables. Add if
needed:

       Salt

Place the pickle in jars and seal them.

                          GREEN TOMATO PICKLE

Wash and cut into thin slices:

     1 peck green tomatoes

Peel and cut into thin slices:

    12 large onions

Sprinkle them with:

     1 cup salt

Permit them to stand for 12 hours. Wash them in clear water. Drain
{pg 712}them. Heat to the boiling point:

     3 quarts cider vinegar
    12 green peppers, sliced thin
     6 sweet red peppers, diced
    12 cloves garlic, minced
     4 pounds brown sugar

Add the tomatoes and onions. Add and cook slowly until the tomatoes are
transparent—for about 1 hour:

     2 tablespoons dry mustard
     2 tablespoons whole cloves
     2 tablespoons stick cinnamon, broken
     2 tablespoons powdered ginger
     1 tablespoon salt
     1 tablespoon celery seed

                              (Senfgurken)

About 14 quarts

These large, luscious, firm slices are served very cold with meat. Pare,
cut into strips of about 1½ x 2½ inches and seed:

     1 bushel large yellow cucumbers

Soak the strips for 12 hours in:

       Brine (page 711)

Drain them well. Sterilize 14 quart fruit jars (page 719). Place in each
one:

       A slice of peeled horseradish[1] 1½ inches long, ⅓ inch wide and ⅓
       inch thick
       A ½ inch piece of long hot red pepper
     4 sprigs of dill blossom with seeds
     1 tablespoon white mustard seed

Prepare the following mixture. Combine:

    1½ gallons of pickling (white) vinegar[2]
     3 cups water
     1 cup sugar (if the vinegar is very acid use 1¼ cups sugar)

Taste these ingredients. They should be palatable, not raw. Boil about 3
cupfuls at a time—enough to cover the bottom of a large saucepan to the
depth of about ½ inch. Keep several pans going to hasten the process.
Immerse in the boiling vinegar sufficient cucumber strips to cover the
bottom of the pan. Let them come to the boiling point. Remove them at
once to the jars. Do not cook the strips longer, as it will soften them.
When a jar is filled with cucumber strips cover them with boiling
vinegar. Seal the jars. Permit the pickle to ripen for at least 6 weeks
before serving it.

[1] If pint fruit jars are used reduce these amounts by one-half.

[2] Other vinegar may be substituted but it will darken the pickle.

     8 cups sugar
     ¼ cup mustard seed

This recipe makes fine hard, crisp pickles.

Thoroughly scrub with a brush:

       About 350 small cucumbers (about 2 inches in length)

Place them in brine for 24 hours (page 711, heavy enough to float a
small potato). Pour boiling water to cover over:

       Small pickling onions

Permit them to stand for 2 minutes. Drain them. Cover them with cold
water. Remove the outer skin. Peel them. Place them in brine (page 711)
for 12 hours. Pour boiling water over them. Drain them. Have ready
sterilized pint jars. Place in the bottom of each jar:

       A head of dill

Cover this with a row of pickles. Peel:

       Horseradish

Add to each jar a block of horseradish about ¼ x ¼ inch high and wide
and ½ inch long. Add 5 or 6 of the onions and:

     ½ inch or more of ginger root
     ¼ inch of long red pepper

Barely fill the jar with pickles. Place 5 or 6 onions on top. Bring to
the boiling point and pour over these ingredients:

     ¼ cup vinegar
     ¼ cup water
     1 cup sugar

Permit the pickles to stand for about 15 minutes. Pour off the liquid.
Boil it again. Add to each jar:

     ¼ teaspoon mustard seed
     ¼ teaspoon celery seed
       A pinch of alum

Pour on the boiling liquid and seal the jars.

                                Canning


Chapters on this subject usually begin with a dry-as-dust definition
{pg 719}of the word “canning.” I am going to assume that you are
familiar with the meaning of the word although you may be unfamiliar
with the process.

Farther on in these pages you may find much practical information, but I
should like to begin my chapter with the assurance that it is a thrill
to possess shelves well stocked with home-canned food. In fact, you will
find their inspection (often surreptitious), and the pleasure of serving
the fruits of your labors, comparable only to a clear conscience or a
very becoming hat.

_To Test Jars, Lids, Rubbers:_

It is important that these be perfect. Jars must be free from leaks or
cracks. Lids must have even unbent edges. Place the lids on the jars
(without a rubber). Screw them down. They are right for use if it is
impossible to insert a thin penknife blade or a thumbnail between the
lid and the jar.

Use new rubbers every year. Bend them into little folds. If the rubbers
crack, discard them. Test them by stretching. If they return to their
original shape they are good rubbers. Fill fruit jars with water. Place
rubbers and lids on them. Screw down the lids. Invert the jars. If there
is no seepage the jars and lids may be used.

_To Sterilize Utensils:_

 Jars:      Wash jars well with soap and hot water. Place them, filled
            with water, either upright or sidewise, well apart in a deep
            pan of cold water. Bring the water slowly to the boiling
            point. Boil it for 15 minutes. Keep the jars hot until ready
            to use them.
 Lids:      Wash all lids well in soap and water. Place zinc and glass
            tops in very hot water for 5 minutes. Invert them to drain.
            Keep them hot until ready to use them. Prepare lids that
            have a sealing composition by pouring hot water over them.
            Allow them to stand until used.
 Rubbers:   Scald rubbers quickly. Do not boil them.
 Utensils:  Sterilize all other utensils to be used in canning by
            washing them first and then placing them in boiling water.

                        Acid and Non-Acid Foods

Foods for canning are considered in two groups: acid and non-acid.

 _Acid Foods:_        Fruits, including tomatoes, pickled products, ripe
                      pimientos and rhubarb.
 _Non-acid Foods:_    Vegetables (the tomato is really a fruit), meats,
                      poultry and fish.

Acid foods may be canned:

                     From an open kettle (page 721)
                     In a hot water bath (page 722)
                     In an oven (page 723)

If the first two methods are used the heat will not exceed the boiling
point, 212° F. If the third is used the food will be somewhat hotter.
{pg 720}Either heat is sufficient to destroy all the bacteria in acid
foods,[1] and if sterilized utensils are used and rules are followed
carefully there should be no subsequent spoilage.

_NON-ACID FOODS MUST BE PROCESSED IN A STEAM PRESSURE CANNER AT 10 OR 15
POUNDS OF STEAM._ This insures a heat 240° to 250° F. which is
sufficient to kill all micro-organisms and bacteria in the non-acid
foods. It is impossible to do this at a lower degree of heat.

The addition of a small amount of acid, lemon juice, vinegar, etc., to
non-acid food does not change the acidity of the food enough to permit
processing by any method other than the pressure canner. The exception
is food pickled in vinegar, which may be processed in a hot water bath.

_NON-ACID FOODS SHOULD NOT BE CANNED AT HOME IF A PRESSURE CANNER IS NOT
AVAILABLE._

                          The Canning of Fruit

Choose fresh, firm, perfect fruit that is not overripe. Imperfect fruit
may be used but it must be carefully gone over and all blemishes
removed.

Wash the fruit. Prepare as for table use. If it is to be peeled it may
be dipped in boiling water until the skins loosen and then for a moment
in cold water. It is best to do this with a small quantity—about a
quart—at a time.

To prevent the discoloration of large fruits after peeling, place them
in brine (2 teaspoons salt to 1 quart water). Drain them well.

If cherries or plums are not seeded prick them several times with a
large pin.

_Sirups for Canning:_

Sirups are thick or thin according to the acidity of the fruit and the
taste of the people for whom you are canning.

                                             _Water or_
 _Sirup_                       _Sugar_     _Fruit Juice_     _Yield_

 Thin sirup................     1 cup        3 cups          3 ½ cups
 Medium sirup..............     1 cup        2 cups          2 ½ cups
 Thick sirup...............     1 cup        1 cup           1 ½ cups

Combine sugar and water. Stir over heat until dissolved. Bring the sirup
to the boiling point.

Allow about two cupfuls of sirup to one quart of large fruit (pears,
peaches, plums). Allow one cupful of sirup to one quart of small fruit
(cherries, berries).

_Canning with Corn Sirup:_

There is no satisfactory substitute for sugar, as it intensifies the
{pg 721}flavor of the food with which it is combined. A sirup of corn
sirup and water without the addition of sugar is subject to mold. Even
with sugar and corn sirup the results are variable. Honey or corn sirup
may be substituted in about the following proportions:

                                      _Corn Sirup_
_Sirup_                     _Sugar_    _or Honey_    _Water_    _Yield_

Thin sirup................     ½ cup  ½ cup            2 cups     2 ¾ cups
Medium sirup..............     1 cup   1 cup           2 cups     3 ½ cups
Thick sirup...............    2 cups   2 cups          2 cups       5 cups

It is unwise to use a higher percentage of corn sirup.

_Canning with Water (Without Sugar or Corn Sirup):_

Substitute boiling water for sugar or sugar and sirup; add it to within
one-half inch of the top of the jars. When ready to use the fruit, drain
it, add sweetening to the water (or juice), bring it to a rolling boil.
Pour it over the fruit, cool, then chill and serve it.

                          Open Kettle Canning

Prepare as for table use:

       Fruit

Prepare by the rule on page 720:

       Sirup for canning fruit

Add a small quantity of fruit to the boiling sirup, about enough for 1
jar. Boil the fruit until it is tender.[1] Boil small fruits slowly.
Test the fruit with a straw or cake tester. Boil cherries for 5 minutes.
If not seeded, prick cherries several times with a large pin. Have ready
a hot sterilized jar with a sterilized rubber in place. Work quickly.
Fill the jar with the fruit. Fill it to overflowing with boiling sirup.
(You will save sirup if you place the jar in a small pan.) Run the
handle of a sterilized spoon around the fruit to make the air bubbles
rise. Wipe the top of the jar free from seeds, pulp or sirup. Seal the
jar at once tightly with a hot sterilized lid. Set the jars well apart
on several thicknesses of cloth. Cool them as rapidly as possible. Avoid
drafts that might crack the jars. Seal screw lids completely. Do not
touch self-sealing lids again. Tighten other screw lids as the jars
cool.

In cooking berries (_except strawberries_) wash them by putting them in
a colander and dipping it up and down in water. Wash 1 quart at a time.
Pick them over. Add 1-2 cups sugar to 1 quart berries. Permit them to
stand for about 2 hours. Cook them with as little stirring as
{pg 722}possible for 20 minutes. Pack boiling hot into sterilized jars.
Use sterilized rubbers and lids. Complete seal at once.

-----

[1] Cook hard fruits (pineapple, some apples, quince, etc.) in boiling
water until nearly tender. Drain them well. Finish cooking them in
sirup. Use the water in which the fruit was cooked for the sirup.

                           Cold Pack Canning

Prepare as directed on page 720:

       Fruit

Pack it into hot sterilized jars with sterilized rubbers in place.
Prepare:

       Sirup for canning (page 720)

Pour the boiling sirup slowly over the fruit to within ½ inch of the
top. If fruit is canned with water, fill the jars to within ½ inch of
the top. Run the handle of a sterilized spoon around the fruit to make
the air bubbles rise. Screw the lids down, but not too tightly. That is,
complete the seal, then turn the screw lid back ¼ inch. Allow this very
little leeway to permit the steam in the jar to escape and to avoid
breakage. If you are using glass-top jars fasten the bail only halfway.
Exception: self-sealing jars. Seal these completely.

Process the jars at once in a hot water bath, pressure canner or by
steaming them in an oven (pages 722, 723).

                            Hot Pack Canning

By this method fruits or vegetables are precooked for a few minutes in
an open kettle. This causes the fruit or vegetable to shrink and
eliminates blanching or dipping. Fruits are precooked in boiling sirup,
vegetables in boiling water. See Charts (pages 725 and 728). Boil only 1
or 2 quarts at a time. Drop the fruit or vegetable gradually into the
boiling liquid so as not to disturb the boiling point. Begin counting
the time when all the fruit is immersed and the liquid boils freely
again.

After cooking, drain the fruit or vegetable. Pack it at once into clean,
hot jars with rubbers in place. Do not crowd the fruit. Fill jars of
fruit to within ½ inch of the top with hot sirup. Seal the jars only
partially, that is, complete the seal, then turn the lid back to loosen
it ¼ inch. Seal self-sealing jars completely. Process immediately in a
pressure canner, hot water bath or oven. (See pages 722, 723.)

                           The Hot Water Bath

A wash boiler is good for this purpose. Any large, deep kettle with
straight sides may be used. Pack jars and seal them as directed for the
Cold Pack or Hot Pack Method.

There is a rack made for the purpose of processing jars, but if you have
none place a wire cake cooler, a wooden rack or similar utensil in the
bottom of the boiler so that the jars will be sufficiently elevated to
permit the water to circulate beneath them. Partly fill the boiler with
boiling water. Place the jars in it, leaving a 2-inch space between them
to allow the water to circulate freely. Cover the jars well with boiling
water. Place a cloth over the top of the boiler before adjusting the lid
to keep in the steam. Bring the water to the boiling point and allow the
time given in the chart (page 725) from that moment on. Keep
{pg 723}water (which must at all times cover the jars) at the boiling
point. Remove the jars, place them on several thicknesses of cloth.
Immediately upon taking the jars from the hot water bath seal them
completely. Tighten the lids again as the jars cool. Exception:
self-sealing lids. Do not touch these. Cool the jars quickly. Avoid
drafts. Test the jars when cold for leakage, see below.

                      Oven Steaming or Processing

Seal jars completely, then turn back top ¼ inch. Seal self-sealing lids
completely. Place the jars 2 inches apart in a shallow pan of warm water
on the center rack of an oven preheated to 275°. See chart (page 725).
Do not permit the heat to fluctuate. Keep the temperature even.
Immediately upon taking the jars from the oven seal them tightly.
Tighten the lids again as the jars cool. Exception: self-sealing lids.
Do not touch these. Place jars on several thicknesses of cloth. Cool the
jars quickly, avoid drafts. Test jars when cold for leakage (see below
or page 724).

                            Pressure Canning

Place filled jars on the rack of the pressure canner containing boiling
water to the level of the rack. If jars are to be processed more than 30
minutes a little more water will be required. Do not crowd the jars;
leave a space of 2 inches between them to allow the steam to circulate.
Clamp the cover into place. Keep the pet cock open until all air has
been forced out of the container (until the steam escapes from it in a
steady stream for 4 to 7 minutes). Close the cock. When the required
pressure is reached begin counting the time given in the charts (pages
725, 728) for processing the product. Adjust the heat to keep the
pressure at a uniform level. This is important. At the end of the
processing period remove the pressure canner at once from the heat.
Permit the gauge to drop to zero and to remain there for 2 minutes
before opening the pet cock slowly. Remove the cover. Remove the jars
and complete the seal. This is unnecessary when patent lids are used. Do
not touch these. Place the jars on several thicknesses of cloth. Keep
the jars well apart and away from drafts to avoid breakage. Cool them
quickly. When cold test them for leakage (see below).

                           Head Space in Jars

Head space in jars is measured by placing a pencil or other thin
straight object across the top of the jar. Fill the packed food to
within one inch of the top, cover it with liquid as directed in these
rules.

                        To Test Jars for Leakage

Containers calling for rubber rings should be permitted to cool. They
are then placed upside down and tested for leakage. Do not invert jars
sealed with self-sealing lids (laquered metal tops). These should be
tapped with a spoon. If the sound has a clear ringing note the jar is
well sealed. If the note is dull a good seal has not been formed. Keep
jars in a cool place for ten days. Test them again during this time.
Reprocess them if necessary. {pg 724}

                           Reprocessing Jars

If jars show any sign of leakage they should be opened and the contents
should be examined. If the lid is imperfect use another sterilized lid.
If the jar is imperfect, heat the food and repack it in a sterilized
jar. If the cover is perfect but the rubber imperfect, replace it with a
new hot rubber. In any case, reprocess the jar for 10 minutes. In case
of a bulging rubber, press it back into shape while the jar is still
hot. If the jar, when inverted, still leaks use a new hot rubber and
reprocess the food for 10 minutes. The food, if reprocessed, will be
over-cooked. To avoid this, it is better to serve it at once.

                                Spoilage

Inspect every jar opened carefully. With glass jars there should be no
bulging of the rubber and no signs of leakage. The odor should be
characteristic of the product. Any different odor probably indicates
spoilage. There should be no outburst of air or spurting of liquid. If
botulinus bacteria have not been destroyed in the canning process they
may grow later and produce a toxin in the food. Never taste a doubtful
product; burn it at once.

_Important Note:_

The Steam Pressure Canner is recommended by the U. S. Department of
Agriculture and Extension Service for processing non-acid vegetables. It
also recommends, “boil ten minutes all canned vegetables {pg 725}before
serving or tasting.”

                These rules are for pint and quart jars.
 Please read the rules for filling and sealing jars to be processed by
                             these methods.

       Huckleberries

Place them in a kettle 1 quart at a time with ¼ cup of water. Sprinkle
them with:

     ¼ teaspoon salt

Cook the berries until they are soft. Stir them from time to time. Fill
hot sterilized jars to overflowing. Seal them partially. Process the
berries for 5 minutes in a hot water bath. Seal them completely.

Add sugar to taste when ready to use the berries. Heat them to dissolve
the sugar.

     ¾ cup sugar

Fill the jars to overflowing with boiling water. Place sterilized lids
on the jars. Seal them at once. Cool. Invert the jars for several hours.
Store them in a cool place for 6 weeks. Strain the juice.

                   RHUBARB, GOOSEBERRIES, CRANBERRIES

Pare and cut into small pieces:

       Young tender rhubarb

Pack it in a sterilized fruit jar. Place the jar under a cold water
faucet. Let the water run for 20 minutes, or pack the rhubarb and cover
it with cold water. After 10 minutes drain off the water. Fill the jar
to overflowing with fresh cold water. Adjust the sterilized rubber and
lid. Screw the lid down tightly.

Gooseberries and cranberries may be canned by this rule.


                         Canning of Vegetables

Successful canning calls for fresh, young, tender vegetables. Have them
as freshly picked as possible, look them over carefully for
imperfections, discard all that are not sound and wash or scrub the rest
thoroughly until they are free from soil. Can only a small amount at a
time.

Tomatoes may be cooked by the Open Kettle Method. See page 727. All
other non-acid vegetables must be either blanched or precooked and then
processed in a pressure canner. See the chart on page 728. The object of
blanching is to shrink the vegetables.

To blanch vegetables use a wire basket or a large colander and a large
kettle. Prepare the vegetables for canning. Boil the water in the
kettle. Place about 4 cupfuls or less of vegetables in the basket or
colander; immerse them in the boiling water. Cook them uncovered. Count
the time given on the chart for blanching from the moment the water
boils again after the vegetables have been immersed. See that the
vegetables are scalded evenly. Spinach and other greens should be
steamed until wilted.

To precook vegetables, drop them, a quart at a time, into boiling water.

Drain the vegetables. Have in readiness clean hot jars with clean
rubbers in place and clean hot lids. Fill only as many containers as
will fit into the pressure cooker at one time. Pack the vegetables
evenly and attractively into the jars. Do not crowd or press them. You
may shake the jars to get a good pack. Since corn, peas and shell beans
{pg 727}are apt to swell, allow about 1 inch space between the liquid
and the top for this. Spinach and other greens are apt to shrink. Press
them down lightly and cut through them several times with a knife. Cover
all vegetables, except those noted above, with boiling water (or with
the water in which they are blanched or cooked) to within ½ inch of the
top. Add 1 teaspoonful of salt to 1 quart of vegetables and water—½
teaspoonful to a pint. Work quickly. Vegetables and water should be
boiling hot. Adjust the lids, screw them down tightly. Allow as short a
time as possible between packing and processing. See Pressure Canning
(page 723).

         Tomatoes.................. 3 lbs.               1 quart

               Tomatoes Canned by the Open Kettle Method

Wash:

       Firm tomatoes

Dip them in boiling water, 4 to 6 at a time. As soon as the skins are
loose remove the tomatoes. Put them in cold water. Core, stem and peel
the tomatoes. They may be cut into pieces. Place them in an open kettle.
Season them with:

       Salt (about 1 teaspoonful of salt to 4 cupfuls of tomatoes)

Bring them very slowly to the boiling point. Stir them frequently to
keep them from sticking to the bottom. Cook them for ½ hour. Fill hot
sterilized jars, with scalded rubbers in place. Wipe rubbers free
{pg 728}of seeds and juice. Seal the jars at once with sterilized lids.

Wash and cut into small pieces:

       Ripe tomatoes

Simmer them (about 4 cupfuls at a time) long enough to have the juice
flow freely. Put them through a fine sieve. Allow to 1 quart of tomato
juice:

     1 teaspoon salt

Vegetables suitable for soup may be {pg 730}cooked with the tomatoes,
such as onions, carrots, celery with tops, etc. You may also add:

       Bay leaf, herbs, etc.[1]

Bring the strained juice to the boiling point. Fill sterilized jars
(sterilized rubbers in place) to overflowing. Seal them at once.

                          ITALIAN TOMATO PASTE

This flavorful paste is diluted in a little boiling water and added to
sauces and soups. Fine in spaghetti and noodle dishes and as a dressing
for cooked vegetables, salads, etc.

Wash and cut into slices:

    1½ pecks (6 quarts) ripe tomatoes

Add:

     3 teaspoons salt

You may add:

     1 large stalk celery cut up with some leaves
     ¾ cup onion chopped
     1 clove of garlic minced (optional)
     3 tablespoons fresh herbs or
     1 tablespoon dried herbs
     ¾ teaspoon peppercorns
    12 cloves
     1 two inch stick of cinnamon

Simmer these ingredients until the tomatoes are soft. Stir frequently.
Put the vegetables through a fine sieve.

Simmer the pulp over hot water or simmer it over direct heat with some
means of protecting it from the bottom, asbestos plate, etc. Stir it
frequently as it burns easily. After several hours when the pulp is
thick and reduced by about one-half, spread the paste to the depth of ½
inch on moist plates. Cut into the paste to permit the air to penetrate.
Place the paste in the sun to dry, or dry it in a slow oven 250°. When
the paste is dry enough to roll, roll it into balls. The balls may be
dipped in salad oil. Store them in airtight jars or store the paste in
layers in a tin box with waxed paper between the layers.

                               SAUERKRAUT

Large quantities

I.

Remove the outer leaves of:

       Firm cabbages

Quarter, core (discard the core), then shred the rest. Weigh it. Place
the shredded cabbage in an earthenware crock in layers with:

     ½ cup of salt to every 10 pounds of cabbage

Use a container large enough to permit the cabbage to ferment and rise
without overflowing.

Press the cabbage with a wooden spoon or potato masher until it is
bruised. Pack it down well. Cover it with a cloth, a plate and a weight
Keep it at 85°. The scum must be removed every day until the cabbage is
cured. See that the cabbage is covered with juice. If it is not, pack it
down. The period of curing depends upon the temperature, from 1 to 3
weeks. Taste the cabbage when it stops fermenting. If it tastes sour it
is ready to be placed in containers. Pack it tightly, cover it with
juice, seal the containers. Sauerkraut may be processed in a hot water
bath in a 275° oven for 30 minutes.

Small quantities

II.

Pack tightly into quart jars to within 1 inch of the top:

       Shredded cabbage

Add to each quart:

     3 scant teaspoons salt

Partly seal the jars. If packed closely the juice will nearly fill the
jar. The sauerkraut should be kept at a temperature of 85°. It is cured
in 6 weeks. After fermentation ceases the lids should be tightly sealed.

                           Successful Canning

To sum up the “musts” and the “don’ts” of successful canning read the
following instructions:

    Sterilize all utensils.

    Use good rubbers. {pg 731}

    Use jars that seal perfectly.

    Pack jars quickly.

    Have the food as hot as possible, the liquid boiling.

    Pack food evenly.

    Shake the jars but do not crowd the contents or press them down.
    The exception is greens. These may be pressed lightly. Cut
    through them several times with a knife to permit the heat to
    penetrate the center.

    Process the jars at once.

    Before sealing, wipe rubbers, free them from seeds, sirup or
    juice.

    Follow the chart for the correct time for processing.

    Immediately after processing, tighten all except self-sealing
    lids.

    Cool the jars quickly.

    Do not invert them.

    Avoid drafts that may crack them.

    When cool, test the jars (see page 723).

    Store jars in a cool, preferably dark place.

If the liquid evaporates in the jar the quality of the food will not be
affected although the appearance may. This may be caused by uneven
temperature, packing the food too closely, or the food may not have been
blanched enough to cause the desired shrinkage. Do not open jars to
refill them.

There should be little risk of botulinus poison in food processed in a
pressure canner. Non-acid vegetables (all vegetables except the tomato,
which is really a fruit) are best canned in this way. The liquid in the
jars should be clear and the food firm and free from mold. There should
be no outburst of air or spurting of liquid. If the liquid is clouded
and the odor bad, destroy the product.

_Caution:_ Never taste canned products if you are in any doubt whatever
as to their quality. Botulinus poison is powerful—do not trifle with
it. All vegetables canned at home should be boiled for ten minutes in an
open vessel before tasting or using.

Keep all vegetable juices for use in stock (page 377) or soup (page 50).

Upon receipt of ten cents, the Superintendent of Documents, Washington,
D. C., will send you the latest Farmer’s Bulletin. This pamphlet covers
the entire subject of canning so thoroughly and adequately that it is
advisable to send for it. Our space does not permit us to handle
{pg 732}this subject in a manner that will do it full justice.




                        Candies and Confections


                         RULE FOR MAKING CANDY

_Utensils:_

Use a heavy aluminum pot and a wooden spoon. Choose a pot that is large
enough to let the sirup boil up without running over—one that holds
about four times as much as the ingredients used. Grease the edge of the
pot to the depth of two inches with butter to prevent the sirup from
boiling over.

A candy thermometer is a great help in candy making. Test it. When water
boils it should register 212°. To avoid breakage, place it in lukewarm
water and heat it gradually before immersing it in the hot sirup. Clean
it by placing it in warm water.

To prevent candy from sugaring add 2 or more tablespoonfuls of corn
sirup to any recipe.

_Cooking:_

Cook candies by stirring them over slow heat until the sugar is
dissolved. Cover the pan for the first three minutes of boiling. The
steam will prevent crystals from forming on the sides of the pan or wipe
away the crystals that may form on the sides of the pan with a dampened
pastry brush or with a wet cloth wrapped around the tines of a fork.

Fondant, candies calling for water and hard candies are then cooked,
without stirring, over rapid heat. This makes the latter crisp and
brilliant. Remove the sirup gently from the fire and permit it to
“settle” for a minute or two before pouring it.

Candies that call for butter, cream, milk, chocolate or molasses are apt
to burn if not stirred while cooking. Dissolve the ingredients for these
candies over quick heat. Cook them slowly after they reach the boiling
point. Do not beat candies until they are cool—almost cold.

Drop butter and flavoring on the surface. Beat them in later.

If candy curdles while cooking, do not be alarmed, it will probably
become smooth when it is beaten. You may add water to sugared candy and
boil it again. {pg 733}

_Degrees:_

_Thread stage_—238 degrees. (When sirup dropped from a spoon spins a
thread of three inches.)

_Soft ball stage_—approximately 238 degrees.

_Firm ball stage_—approximately 244 to 250 degrees.

_Hard ball stage_—270 to 290 degrees.

_Crack stage_—290 to 310 degrees.

If you have no candy thermometer have a cup of cold water in readiness.
Drop a very little of the boiling sirup into it. When the sirup can be
gathered up in the fingers into a soft ball that will almost hold its
shape it has reached the soft ball stage—238 degrees. When the sirup
can be gathered up in the fingers into a ball that will hold its shape
it has reached the firm ball stage—250 degrees. When the sirup becomes
firm and cracks when knocked against the side of the cup it has reached
the crack or hard ball stage—290 degrees.

_Oiling:_

Oil pans or slabs that are to be used for all candy, except fondant,
with olive oil. Use a brush to spread it. Do not at any time oil marble
that is to be used for fondant. Moisten it with water.

_Pulling:_

When pulling candy dip the hands frequently in cold water. If gloves are
used, grease them lightly and dip them in flour. A candy hook is a great
help when pulling large quantities of candy. It should be placed on a
level with the eyes.

_Weather Conditions:_

The weather is a big factor in candy making. It is impossible to make
good hard candies in a moist, hot atmosphere. They become sticky, then
sugary. It is advisable to take this into consideration when making all
candies and to cook them to two degrees higher than in dry, cold
weather.

_Dipping:_

This is best done in a room that is about 65 degrees in temperature.
Melt chocolate for dipping at a very low heat.

_Wrapping:_

Wrap candies in small squares of waxed paper. Store them in tin boxes.

_Beating Candy Mixtures with an Electric Mixer:_

Pour the cooked candy mixtures, while hot, into a large bowl. Add the
butter and the flavoring. Beat the candy at high speed. Add the nuts and
pour the candy onto oiled platters.

                             COOKED FONDANT

Stir in a saucepan over slow heat until dissolved:

     3 cups sugar
     1 cup cold water

Wipe the sides of the pan with a damp pastry brush or a damp cloth
wrapped around the tines of a fork, so that no sugar will adhere to it.
Cook these ingredients quickly, without stirring, to the soft ball stage
238° (see above). Add, if desired, a little:

       Coloring

Pour the sirup onto a marble slab, a buttered enameled table top or
large platter. Use only what will pour; do not scrape the pan. When
thoroughly cool stir the sirup with a spatula or fork. Always work from
the edges to the center. When the sirup begins to cream knead it well
with the {pg 734}hands. Cover it with a damp cloth and permit it to
stand for 10 minutes before using it.

The fondant may be set aside in an airtight container (sealed jar, tin
box, etc.) in a cold place where it will keep fresh for a long time.

Flavor the fondant as you use it with:

       Peppermint
       Almond
       Wintergreen

An inexperienced candy maker may make sure of her results by adding to
the boiling sirup:

     ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar

                 *        *        *        *        *

                             CREAMY FONDANT

A soft melting fondant.

Place in a saucepan:

     2 cups sugar
     1 cup water
     ¼ teaspoon glycerine
     1 tablespoon white corn sirup

Stir these ingredients until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved. Place
the pan over slow heat. When the mixture begins to boil cover it so that
the steam will wash down any crystals that may form on the side of the
pan. Cook the sirup for 3 minutes. Remove the cover. Continue cooking
the sirup until it reaches the soft ball stage 238° (page 733). Remove
it gently from the fire. Pour it onto a wet slab or platter. Cool the
sirup until it is lukewarm.

Spread over it with a spatula:

     1 well-beaten egg white

Follow the preceding rule for Cooked Fondant to work and shape it. Dip
the fondant in:

       Chocolate Coating (page 744)

This must be done at once as the egg white causes this fondant to soften
quickly.

                       ALMOND PASTE AND MARZIPAN

About 2 pounds

In some parts of Europe this confection is traditional at Christmastime.
It is molded into fancy shapes and frequently into flat cakes that are
pie shaped and elaborately decorated. A thin wedge is served a visitor
together with a glass of dessert wine.

Blanch:

     1 pound almonds

Grind them. All my other rules for grinding almonds read: “Put through a
nut grinder.” This is the only rule that says: “Put them through a meat
grinder.” This time you want the nuts to be oily. Use the finest knife
and grind the almonds at least 4 times.

Cook just past the thread stage—240°:

     2 cups sugar
     1 cup water

Add the grated almonds and:

     6 to 8 tablespoons orange juice
       A few drops of rose water.[1]

Stir these ingredients until they are thoroughly blended and creamy.
Knead them toward the end. Flatten them out on a hard surface dusted
with confectioner’s sugar. Permit the paste to cool. Pack it in a
closely covered tin or in a fruit jar. Permit it to ripen from 6 to 8
days.

Marzipan:

Whip until fluffy:

     1 egg white

Work in gradually:

     1 cup almond paste

Add:

       Confectioner’s sugar

until it makes a paste that is easy to handle. Should it become too
thick, work in drop by drop:

       Lemon juice

Knead the paste. Mold it into any desired shape. Use a pastry brush to
color it, if you wish, with a little diluted coloring, or you may roll
it in:

       Equal parts of cocoa and
       powdered sugar

Wrap each piece separately in waxed paper. Store the marzipan closely
covered in a cool place. It dries out easily.

-----

[1] Rose water is a highly desirable addition to almond paste as it is
its traditional flavor. Other flavors may be substituted.

           CHOCOLATE COATED FONDANT BALLS (Uncooked Fondant)

Tempting, opulent looking—not for reducers. This candy is the specialty
of a very clever hostess, whose parties seem incomplete without them.
Her son calls them “knockout drops” because he once indulged in thirteen
and suffered the consequences.

Beat until soft:

     ½ cup butter

Add very slowly and cream until {pg 735}very light:

     1 pound XXXX Sugar

Add:

     4 tablespoons rich, thick cream
     1 scant teaspoon vanilla

Work the fondant well with the hands and shape it into 1½ inch balls.[1]
To roll the balls use about:

     ¼ pound XXXX sugar

Place the balls on waxed paper in the refrigerator until they are hard.
Follow the rule on page 744 for:

       Chocolate Coating

Cool it slightly. Dip the balls into the chocolate coating with a fork.
Place them on waxed paper. Permit them to harden. Place the balls in a
closed fruit jar in the refrigerator until ready to serve them.

-----

[1] A maraschino cherry, drained and wiped dry, a piece of date or fig,
a few raisins or nut meats or a bit of candied fruit may be rolled into
the center of the balls.

                            UNCOOKED FONDANT

Beat until well blended:

     1 egg white
     1 tablespoon cold water and
     2 tablespoons evaporated milk or 3 tablespoons cream
     1 teaspoon vanilla or a few drops of peppermint or wintergreen

Add very slowly until the fondant is thick enough to knead:

       Sifted confectioner’s sugar

Knead and work it until it is smooth.[1] Cover it with a damp cloth and
permit it to stand for 1 hour before using it. It may be set aside in a
sealed jar in a cool place and used when desired.

Combine and stir:

     1 egg white
     2 tablespoons evaporated milk
     1 teaspoon maple extract

Work in sufficient:

       Confectioner’s sugar

This makes the best fudge imaginable—rich, soft and creamy. As the
ingredients used do not differ materially from dozens of other fudge
recipes, the manner of making it is undoubtedly responsible for the
success. When you eat this observe the feed limit.

                         ORANGE PASTE with NUTS

This candy will soften readily in hot weather. It is a great favorite
with young people. Mine have nick-named it “amoebas.”

Soak for 5 minutes:

     2 tablespoons gelatine

in:

     ¼ cup cold water

Stir and boil over slow heat until the sugar is dissolved:

     2 cups sugar
     ½ cup water

Add the soaked gelatine. Boil the sirup for 10 minutes over a quick
flame. Use an asbestos plate under the saucepan to keep the sirup from
burning, or cook it in a double boiler for 20 minutes. Place on a
lightly greased platter:

     ½ pound finely chopped nut meats

Grate over them:

       The rind of 1 lemon
       The rind of 1 orange

Sprinkle over them:

       The juice of 1 lemon
       The juice of 1 orange
     6 drops rose water (optional)
     ½ teaspoon vanilla

Pour the sirup over these ingredients. The paste should be about ¼ inch
thick. Chill it for 6 hours or more. Cut it into squares. Roll them in:

                           CHOCOLATE COATING

I am giving a recipe for chocolate coating that is in general use.
However, both bitter chocolate and milk chocolate may be melted by a
very slow process (over warm—not hot—water) and used for dipping,
after the chocolate has been melted and is almost cold, with excellent
results. {pg 745}If you find milk chocolate too sweet, use milk and
bitter chocolate in equal parts.

Place in a shallow pan over warm water:

     4 ounces chocolate
     2 tablespoons butter
     1 inch square of paraffin

Stir these ingredients until they are melted and blended. Add:

     5 drops of vanilla

Remove them from the fire and when they are nearly cool put the food to
be dipped in the coating on a fork, dip it quickly and place it on a
piece of waxed paper to dry, or on a piece of white oilcloth stretched
on a board. (The latter is the better of the two.)


                           Candied Fruit Peel

Here are two recipes for grapefruit or orange peel—both very good. The
first can be made in an hour or two; the second requires twenty-four
hours’ soaking. The first is a moist peel. The second has a more sugared
quality.

                  CANDIED GRAPEFRUIT or ORANGE PEEL I

Cut into strips:

       Grapefruit or orange peel

Cover it with cold water. Bring it slowly to the boiling point. Remove
it from the fire. Drain it well. Repeat this process, boiling the peel
in five waters in all. Drain it well each time. Make a sirup allowing:

     ¼ cup water and ½ cup sugar

to the peel of 1 grapefruit or 2 large oranges. Add the peel and boil it
until all the sirup is absorbed. Cool the peel. Roll it in:

       Sugar

Spread it to dry. The sugared peel, when thoroughly dry, may be dipped
in:

       Chocolate Coating (see page 744)

                 *        *        *        *        *

       Grapefruit or orange peel

Soak it for 24 hours in:

       Salt water to cover (1 tablespoon salt to 4 cups water)

Drain the peel, rinse it and soak it for 20 minutes in fresh water.
Drain it, cover it with fresh water and boil it for 20 minutes and drain
it again. Measure:

       Sugar (as much as you have peel)

Cook the peel (adding a very little water only if necessary) until it
has absorbed the sugar. Shake the pot as the sirup diminishes so that
the peel will not burn. This method does not call for rolling the peel
in additional sugar.

Make a sirup by boiling for 10 minutes:

    1¼ cups water
    2½ cups sugar

Reserve ½ cupful of this. Add to the remainder, stir, cover and permit
to stand for 30 minutes or more:

     1 cup lemon juice
     2 cups orange juice
     1 cup strong tea
     2 cups white grape juice, grapefruit juice, pineapple juice or
       crushed pineapple
     2 cups fruit sirup (preferably raspberry or loganberry)[1]

If you find the punch lacking in sugar, add part or all of the reserved
sugar sirup.

[1] This, I find, is the hitch. Your punch is apt to be just as good as
this touch. Strawberry jam may be diluted and strained, canned raspberry
or loganberry juice may be sweetened and boiled until heavy.

                Cocktails and Other Alcoholic Beverages

A commentator says: “Alcohol does not give you courage. It simply makes
you see things as they should be.”

If you can pry your family loose from the generally accepted American
custom of serving a cocktail before dinner, serve dry sherry (at room
temperature) or vermouth (cold—temperature about 45 degrees).

                              MEASUREMENTS

       1 dash                 =  6      drops, or about ⅓ teaspoon
       3 teaspoons            =  1      tablespoon (¼ oz.)
       1 pony                 =  1      ounce
       1 jigger               =  1½     ounces
       1 large jigger         =  2      ounces
       1 glass or wineglass   =  4      ounces

When making Tom Collins or other drinks calling for effervescent water,
add the water at the last minute so that it will retain its sparkle.

                          Sirup for Beverages

A simple sirup is a useful ingredient when making drinks. Keep it in a
bottle in the refrigerator and use it as needed. Boil for five minutes 1
part water to 2 parts sugar (one-half as much water as sugar).

In addition to various liquors, it is advisable for the home bartender
to have on hand a stock of the following:

                       Bitters
                       Olives
                       Cherries

                                EGGNOG I

About 5 quarts

A rich and extravagant version that is correspondingly good. I shall not
attempt to give the number of servings as I am a poor judge of thirst
and capacity. An authority (Mark Twain) says, “Too much of anything is
bad, but too much whisky is just enough.”

     1 pound confectioner’s sugar

Add very slowly, beating constantly:

     1 quart rum, brandy or whisky

                   EGGNOG III (With Evaporated Milk)

8 Servings

This must be prepared a day ahead of time. It is smooth, good and made
with ingredients one is apt to have on hand. Less “calorious” than the
usual eggnog.

Diluted with:

     ¾ cup water

If an alcoholic flavor is desired, omit the vanilla and add:

     ½ cup brandy, whisky, etc.

Place the eggnog in a jar with a screw top. Permit it to ripen in the
refrigerator for 24 hours. Serve it sprinkled with:

                               MINT JULEP

The _New Yorker_ had a most amusing story of a bartender who thought he
knew how to make mint julep. As he was following his favorite
{pg 760}formula one day he was interrupted by a southern gentleman, who
was horrified to find that the bartender was chopping the mint. The
southerner, apparently a man of authority, told him that the mint must
be bruised, not chopped. So he followed his instructions until one day
he was vehemently interrupted by another southerner, who told him that
mint must never be bruised, it must be left whole—and so on through
endless experiences and endless corrections, until the poor bartender
had a nervous breakdown and still did not know the really correct way to
prepare a mint julep. Neither do I. It is without any feeling of
superiority that I venture to give the following recipe, which I offer
as a suggestion only:

                 *        *        *        *        *

                         TO FROST A MINT JULEP

The quickest way is to place the julep cup on several folds of dry
newspaper. This acts as an insulator. Fill the cup with ice and julep
mixture and stir it vigorously with a bar spoon or an iced-tea spoon. A
slower way is to mix the julep and place it for half an hour in a
refrigerator.

                        TO PREPARE A MINT JULEP

Chill silver julep cups or 12-ounce glasses. Pick from stem and place in
cup:

     4 or 5 mint leaves

Muddle with:

     1 teaspoon powdered sugar
     1 teaspoon water

Fill cup with finely crushed ice. Pour in:

     1 jigger bourbon whisky

Stir energetically until the ice has dropped one or two inches and frost
begins to appear. Then fill remainder of julep cup with crushed ice and
pour in:

     1 jigger bourbon whisky

Decorate the julep with:

       Sprigs of mint dusted with powdered sugar

Insert short straws. (Long straws are apt to short-circuit the flavor of
the drink and make it too strong.) Place the julep in the refrigerator
for half an hour—if you are not too impatient. A connoisseur I know
likes to add to each julep a finger length of fresh pineapple and a
slice of thick skinned orange.

                        MINT JULEPS for PARTIES

Mint julep in mass production becomes a problem. You may solve it by
mixing simple sirup (page 754) and mint leaves ahead of time. Refills
may be poured from a pitcher. Place whisky mixed with mint sirup in the
pitcher around a single piece of ice and have it passed with separate
bowls of mint and crushed ice. For refills metal cups may be prechilled
in the refrigerator.

                 GRAPE, BLACKBERRY or OTHER BERRY WINE

Mash in a stone jar:

    20 pounds grapes or other fruit

Add:

     5 quarts boiling water

Cover the jar. Permit these ingredients to stand for 3 days. Strain the
fruit through a cheesecloth bag. Return the juice to the jar. Add:

    10 cups sugar

Cover the jar. Permit these ingredients to stand until fermentation has
ceased. Remove the scum. Strain the juice. Bottle it tightly. Seal the
bottles with sealing wax.

                           BLACKBERRY CORDIAL

Boil:

       Blackberries

Add a little water to keep them from scorching. When they are soft put
the juice through a jelly bag. Add to each quart of juice:

     2 cups sugar
     ½ stick cinnamon
     2 tablespoons cloves
     ¼ ounce mace or allspice

Boil these ingredients for 20 minutes. Strain them. Add to each quart of
juice:

     1 pint French brandy

                 *        *        *        *        *

                              PEACH BRANDY

Pare: {pg 761}

       Clingstone peaches (Albertas)

Place them in quart jars. Cover them with:

       Sugar

Cover the jars loosely with lids. Continue to cover the peaches with
sugar until the juice is drawn from them and the sugar is dissolved.
When the peaches are covered with juice tighten the lids on the jars.
Wrap the jars in heavy paper and place them in a cool dark place. The
peaches are ready to be served in three months. Use them sliced over ice
cream or pudding. Pour off the liquid and bottle it. This makes
delicious brandy.

                             CHERRY BOUNCE

Stem and place in a crock:

     6 pounds cherries

Add:

     5 pounds sugar (10 cups)[1]
     1 pint alcohol

Cover the crock. Stir the cherries twice a day until the sugar is
dissolved (for about 3 days). Cover the crock tightly. After 5 months
add:

     1 pint distilled water

Strain the liquid. Bottle it.

[1] This measurement is for acid cherries. Use less if the cherries are
not acid.

                             QUINCE LIQUEUR

The formula for this delicious and unusual liqueur was given by a French
priest to his friends. When you drink it remember the advice of the old
German who said when serving a fine vintage, “Don’t gullop it, zipp it!”

Wash and core:

       Quinces

Put them through a food grinder. Add to 4 quarts of ground quince:

     3 gallons rye whisky
     1 ounce cardamon seed
     ½ ounce mace
     1 ounce anise seed
     ½ vanilla bean
     1 ounce broken nutmeg

Place these ingredients for 3 weeks in a stone jar with a tight cover.
Stir them frequently. Strain them through a flannel jelly bag. Make a
rich sirup of:

    10 pounds best granulated sugar
     7 pints water

Cool, then add it to the liqueur. Bottle and seal it.

                        On the Serving of Wines

Here are a few suggestions to guide the inexperienced hostess.

With few exceptions wines are served at 45 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

Champagne is always served cold—35 to 40 degrees. It should be cooled
gradually in a refrigerator and placed in ice shortly before being used.
The younger vintages of champagne call for 35 degrees, the older for 40
degrees.

Either champagne or a medium dry sherry is suitable to serve at all
times and with all foods and throughout a meal.

Some of the generally accepted customs on the serving of wine are:

Serve dry wines before sweet wines; white wines before red ones; light
wines before heavier ones; white wines with hors d’œuvre, fish and white
meats; red wines with dark meats, game and cheeses. {pg 762}

                                 Herbs


Numerous books and articles have been written recently on herbs,
{pg 763}how to grow them and how to use them. It is impossible to
condense all this lore into a few paragraphs, as the approach to the
subject is handled reverently by some writers and exhaustively by all.

After decades of neglect we are being made nationally herb-conscious.
Many cooks smile at this vibrant revival of a custom they have never
permitted to lapse into oblivion. They have always found room for a bit
of tarragon in a garden corner, a sprout of chervil, basil, etc., or if
minus a garden, a neighbor or truck gardener has been persuaded to grow
them. Now, suddenly the cultivation of herbs has become a cult and it
threatens to engulf us.

If this subject is new to you, buy a good book on herbs and let it be
your guide. There are various schools of thought represented, which
bring about an enlivening, if not always enlightening, controversy.

My rules are elastic, culled from a number of herb-growing friends and
authorities with assailable but unbending convictions. I fully expect
some protest about whatever I might say, for social ostracism seems to
follow in the wake of a vagrant savory or a misplaced camomile. Epicures
are insistent upon wedding the right herb to the right dish and in some
circles only the brave venture forth on a doubtful alliance. It is
advisable to suppress your iconoclastic urges until you know your herbs,
then use them as you please. However, a break in the conventions cannot
be much worse than a split infinitive or a double negative and they have
been known to creep into the best of families.

There are no limits to the use of herbs. They are a delightful addition
to our everyday cooking, but even the most enthusiastic grower should
use them with discretion. A pinch of herb adds a wonderful touch to a
creamed dish, salad, soup or meat. Use herbs fresh or dried. Keep an
assortment of the latter on your pantry shelf. Determine what you
like—some are strong flavored, others mild, and their use is a matter
of individual preference.

Herbs are picked for drying as they come into flower. They are washed,
hung in bunches in a shady, airy room or dried in a very slow oven 250°
and when thoroughly dry, they are pulverized and placed in closed
containers. Packaged and bottled herbs are purchasable in most
groceries. A number of people find growing herbs for the market a good
source of income. Herbs put up by these amateur growers seem to retain a
more delicate flavor than those put out in quantity by wholesale houses.

Keep on hand a supply of herb bags to season soups and stews calling for
a bouquet garni. To make them, cut four-inch squares of heavy
cheesecloth, place in the center of each a combination of ½ teaspoon
each of dried basil, thyme, marjoram and savory or other herbs, celery,
parsley, etc. Gather the four corners together, tie them securely; pull
off ravelings. Place the bags in a covered jar until ready to use them.

My friend, Herman Smith, the author of two delightful books, _Stina and
Kitchens Near and Far_, has kindly permitted me to use the following
rule from his incomparable _Stina: the Story of a Cook_.

The herb powder without which Stina declared she could not cook was
prepared at the end of summer before the seed flowers bloomed. Gathered
and dried, the herbs would be weighed on Stina’s small balancing scales:
two ounces each of sweet marjoram, savory, parsley and thyme; an ounce
of basil; a half-ounce each of sage, bay leaves, celery tops and dried
lemon peel. These she would pound to a powder with a wooden pestle, and
it was this delicious concoction which was the secret of so many of
Stina’s masterpieces. {pg 764}

                    Invalid or Convalescent Cookery


We now know that no food is good in itself. Even milk, once considered
{pg 765}innocuous, has proved to be harmful to some people. However,
there are many who are fortunate in being free from allergies, and when
a doctor says to one of them, “I recommend a light diet,” he usually has
in mind foods that are easily digested, unspiced and bland. A well
person may sigh at the list, but an invalid will be benefited by
sticking to it.

Toast, milk toast, cooked cereals, eggs, green vegetables, riced or
baked potatoes, scraped beef, creamed chicken or sweetbreads, stewed
fruits put through a ricer or strainer, custards, eggnog, ice
cream—there is usually a great variety of dishes but they are apt to
become monotonous. Here are a few suggestions that may prove of use:

               Recipes and Suggestions for Left-Over Food


Some of the most tempting luncheon dishes are made from icebox scraps.
Do not disdain them.

On one occasion I had to confess, when asked by an enthusiastic guest
for a soufflé recipe, that it was composed of a twelve-cent can of fish
flakes, some celery and yesterday’s broccoli.

Both soufflés and timbales lend themselves readily as a basis for using
up the odds and ends to be found in any refrigerator.

Tomatoes, peppers, onions, eggplant, acorn squash, summer squash,
turnips, avocados, cucumbers, pimientos, baked potatoes and carrots may
be filled with left-over meat, fish, potatoes, rice or vegetables, alone
or in some good combination. Moisten these ingredients with gravy, cream
sauce, butter, eggs, bacon fat, milk or cream and combine them with dry
bread, bread crumbs, onions, nut meats, etc. Prepare and fill the cases
and cook them as directed (pages 198-210).

Waffle, pancake and fritter batter combine well with meat, fish or
vegetables. Add three-fourths to one cup of finely minced or ground
left-over food to waffle batter, cook the waffles and serve them with
cream or other sauce, or gravy, etc. See Filled Pancakes (page 119),
Fritters (page 478).

Deep custard cups are useful for serving small amounts of left-overs.
Fill them with moistened, seasoned food, cover the tops with pieces of
buttered paper secured with string or rubber bands, and place the cups
in a pan partly filled with boiling water. Steam the food on top of the
stove or in the oven until it is thoroughly heated. Remove the papers.
If desired, the tops may be sprinkled with bread crumbs dotted with
butter or sprinkled with cheese and browned under a broiler.

                         (Kitchenette Cooking)

This chapter is written as an aid to those who struggle with the
fleeting and never to be recovered element—time!

There are many good meals that may be prepared in thirty minutes and a
great aid toward this end is a well-stocked emergency shelf.


                  Suggestions for the Emergency Shelf

=COCKTAILS:=

Canned fruit juices, vegetable juices, clam broth, etc., to be used as
suggested in the chapter on Cocktails, page 17.

Acquaint yourself with what the market offers and with what the producer
recommends.

=SEA FOOD:=

Keep several cans of fish on hand:

 Fish flakes                         Lobster
 Salmon                              Finnan haddie
 Tuna                                Codfish cakes
 Crabmeat                            Oysters
 Shrimp                              Shad
 Sardines                            Shad roe, etc.
 Herring

Keep the liquid from canned fish for the soup pot (see Stock, page 50).

=FROSTED SEA FOOD:=

Full instructions for the cooking of frosted sea food are to be found on
the label of the package containing it. Consult these carefully for best
results and (important) buy it a day in advance. It will keep
indefinitely in the freezing unit of an electric refrigerator. It will
defrost slowly, placed in another part of the refrigerator. Once
defrosted, use it as soon as possible.

=To Prepare Canned and Frosted Sea Food:=

    Open the can, drain the contents, reserve the liquor. Pick over
    crab to remove the tendons. Remove the intestinal vein from
    shrimp. Remove salmon skins. Drain oysters well. Part of the
    oyster liquor may be {pg 773}used with cream for cream sauce.
    When it is boiling add the oysters.

    Sea food may be marinated in 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls of lemon juice
    for one hour. Especially good in the case of salmon and tuna
    fish. Shrimp are frequently very salty. Soak them in cold water
    for 1 hour (optional), then drain them well, or place them in
    unsalted sauce. Tuna fish may be placed in a colander and rinsed
    quickly with hot water. This cuts the oil.

=HORS D’ŒUVRE:=

 Cheese                              Deviled ham
 Crackers, pretzels, etc.            Onions and pickles
 Popcorn                             Sandwich spreads
 Fish paste, sardines, anchovies,    See Hors d’Œuvre, page 41
   etc.

=CANNED SOUPS:=

Canned soups of all kinds to be used alone or in combinations as
suggested in the section on Emergency Soups, page 68, or to be used in
gravies and creamed dishes.

=BOUILLON or VEGETABLE CUBES:=

To be diluted in water or canned vegetable juices for soup, broth or
gravies (see Stock, page 50).

=CANNED VEGETABLES and STARCHY FOODS:=

In addition to the usual tomatoes, corn, peas and beans, consider Irish
or sweet potatoes, French fried or creamed potatoes, baked beans, Lima
beans, asparagus, beets, celery, onions, mixed vegetables, etc. Macaroni
in Cheese Sauce, spaghetti, ravioli, etc.

Keep the liquid from canned vegetables for the soup pot (see Stock, page
50).

=FROSTED VEGETABLES:=

Frosted vegetables are of excellent quality, fresh and well flavored.
They are great timesavers as the vegetables are hulled or cleaned and
ready for the pot. These vegetables will keep indefinitely in the
freezing unit of an electric refrigerator. Once defrosted, it is
advisable to use them at once.

=MEATS, CANNED, DRIED, ETC.:=

 Roast beef                          Ham and ham mixtures
 Bacon                               Hamburger steak and onions

 Chop Suey                           Veal loaf, etc.
 Chow Mein

=FROSTED MEATS:=

Frosted meat is not to be confused with cold-storage meat. It is
advisable for the hurry-up cook to buy all frosted meat a day in
advance. Placed on the shelf of the refrigerator it will defrost slowly.
Once defrosted, meat deteriorates. It should be used as soon as possible
afterward. Full instructions for the use of frosted meat will be found
printed on the container in which it is wrapped.

Frosted meats are a wonderful convenience. If you have the space it is
wise to devote a refrigerator tray to the storage of several of these
neat packages against a rainy day. This saves marketing in times of
stress. So placed, the meat will keep indefinitely. These meats may be
cooked frosted or thawed. Once they are defrosted do not attempt to
freeze them again. In {pg 774}the defrosted state they will keep as long
as fresh meat under the same conditions.

=CANNED SAUCES:=

Canned soups make good sauces (see Quick Sauces, page 392). Thicken the
liquid from canned vegetables and fish for sauces (see pages 377 to
379).

You may buy:

 Barbecue sauce                      Cocktail sauce
 Beefsteak sauce                     Hollandaise sauce

=CANNED FOODS FOR SALADS:=

Flavored gelatine powders, lemon, lime, meat, etc., also unflavored
gelatine for molded salads. (These salads solidify quickly over cracked
ice.) Canned fish, meat and vegetables. You will find many rules for
quick salads in the chapter on Salads (page 402). Examples:

 Asparagus with French dressing      Whole apricots in lettuce cups with
                                       rather thin nut mayonnaise
 Marinated beets                     Pears on lettuce with French
                                       dressing, to which chutney or
                                       chopped ginger is added
 Quick tomato aspics and other aspic Chilled pear halves filled with
   salads                              chili sauce on lettuce or
                                       watercress, etc.
 Pineapple slices on lettuce with
   cream cheese and mayonnaise

=CHEESE:=

 Welsh rarebit, canned               Potted cheese

commercial cheese spread.

=QUICK BREADS, BISCUITS, WAFFLES, PANCAKES, ETC.:=

Innumerable fine rolls and breads may be bought; even biscuits come in
cans ready to be baked, and luscious-looking beaten biscuits, large and
small, may be purchased at most groceries neatly packed in cellophane.
{pg 775}

To reheat anything cooked, place it in a hot oven. A slow oven will dry
it out. All kinds of bread and buns are best reheated by placing them
loosely in a paper bag, closing it well and placing it in a quick oven
425° until the contents are well heated—or by sprinkling bread, etc.,
lightly with water and placing it in a closely covered double boiler
over boiling water until it is hot. (You may treat cold homemade
products in the same way.)

As for canned breads (pumpernickel, Boston brown, prune, date, nut,
chocolate nut, etc.) they are a find for the efficiency housekeeper. Be
sure to have one or more of these inexpensive and tempting loaves on
your emergency shelf.

=QUICK BISCUITS, BREADS, WAFFLES, MADE WITH BISCUIT MIX:=

You will find a number of brands from which to choose the biscuit mix,
corn-bread mix, etc., you like best. Instructions for the many uses to
which these excellent flour mixtures may be put are printed on the
package or label. They include biscuits, fancy biscuits, shortcake,
muffins, pies, waffles and pancakes. Upon request the manufacturers will
send you booklets telling you of other good things to make—dumplings,
sweet rolls, coffee cakes, cakes, puddings, etc.

See rules for good, quick Homemade Biscuit Mix (page 451) and for quick
Homemade Waffle Mix (page 490), Shortcake with Homemade Biscuit Mix
(page 451).

=QUICK PIES AND SHORTCAKES—CRUSTS AND FILLINGS:=

You may buy both prepared pie-crust mix and pie filling (lemon,
chocolate, etc.). Many of the pudding powders (butterscotch, vanilla,
strawberry, etc.) are used for pie fillings, and strudel dough comes
ready to be filled, rolled and baked. Mincemeat comes canned and so does
pumpkin.

Frozen pies are now available commercially ready to be slipped into the
oven. Frozen cakes are soon to follow.

Prepare homemade pie-crust mix by following your rule for pie crust.
Omit the liquid and place the mix in a closed container in the
refrigerator. When ready to use it add the necessary liquid. This mix
will keep indefinitely in a cold place.

=CANNED FRUITS:=

These are too well known to require listing. Keep a variety on hand for
pie fillings, cakes, quick desserts, etc.

=FROSTED FRUITS:=

The advantage of buying these is that you may have a delicious fresh
fruit out of season at a reasonable price. These fruits will keep
indefinitely in the freezing units of an electric refrigerator. Once
defrosted, use the fruit as soon as possible.

=PUDDINGS, CAKES AND COOKIES:=

Keep on hand a number of flavored gelatine powders, lemon, orange, etc.,
as well as unflavored gelatine, for molded puddings. Several prepared
pudding mixtures—chocolate, caramel, vanilla, etc.

One or more canned steamed puddings—date, plum, spice, etc.

Canned or packaged cookies and cakes. Gingerbread or chocolate cake mix.
Ice cream mix for quick ice cream. {pg 776}

                                       over hot water
 The juices from canned fruits, to   Jelly or preserves to dilute with
   which you may add grated lemon or   water or fruit juice over hot
   orange rind                         water, to which you may add
                                       grated lemon or orange rind
 A can of puréed fruit (baby food)
   to which you may add the grated
   rind and the juice of an orange
   and (optional) 2 tablespoons of
   rum or whisky

=BEVERAGES, ETC.:=

 Powdered coffee                     Condensed milk
 Prepared cocoa                      Evaporated milk, etc.
 Malted milk

                Facts to Know about Storing Canned Foods

_Unused portions_ from a can should be covered and kept in a cool place,
preferably a refrigerator.

_It is entirely safe_ to leave food in the open can if it is covered and
stored in a cool place, like any other cooked food. Some acid foods, if
left in a can when exposed to the air, tend to act on the metal of the
can and dissolved iron may give the contents of the can a slightly
astringent taste, which is displeasing but harmless.

_Canned foods_ will keep without spoilage as long as the can is sealed
airtight.

_Can sizes_ differ with various products, and canners try to supply
sizes best meeting consumer needs.

_Cans_ bought economically in case or dozen lots should be stored in a
dry place, the cooler the better, but not below freezing temperature.

_No harm_ is done if rust accumulates on the outside of cans, unless the
can rusts through and leaks.

_Freezing_ does not lessen the nutritive value of canned foods but may
change the appearance.

_Contents_ of dented cans are safe to use, unless the dent has caused
the can to leak.

_Bulging cans_ are an indication of spoilage and should be immediately
returned unopened to the grocer.


                          The Pressure Cooker

There is a gadget on the market that permits a cook to scoff at time. It
is a pressure cooker that looks like an ordinary stewpan with a valve,
(not to be confused with a pressure canner).

A small amount of water is placed in the pan. Food is placed on a rack
slightly above it. The handle is clamped down. The pot is placed over
heat. When the water boils, a matter of a minute or two, the food is
steamed according to directions. Asparagus or green beans are done in
about fifteen seconds, Lima beans or peas in one minute, delicious mealy
potatoes in eight minutes and so on.

Meats, fish and cereals are good cooked in this way and they are ready
in an unbelievably short time. Flavor and vitamins remain intact.

                             Calorie Chart


A malediction on the first calorie counter (must have been a man)
{pg 781}and a malediction on Helen Hokinson who shows those whose
glamour has begun to glimmer that calories count! Joy killers, both.

A calorie chart is not a diet chart, nor is a cookbook writer a doctor.
Her advice is to consult a doctor before you diet—and as to whether or
not you decide to consult: “Let your contours be your guide.”

It’s fun to count other people’s caloric intake. Make a game of it. (If
you are not naturally a mathematician this calls for pencil and paper.)
Watch the calories mount.

Yes, you _may_ eat and grow thin. It isn’t nearly as much fun as giving
your appetite a free rein, but if you are inclined to take on soft, but
unfortunately much-dated curves, a concentration on non-caloric food
(with only an occasional indulgence) is advisable.

                                 Menus


Planning menus for others is difficult. Standards, traditions, budgets,
{pg 789}diet restrictions and individual taste play a large part in
deciding upon the type of food that is to be served, and in wartime
rationed food and food shortages must also be considered.

On the other hand, dishes of all countries and kinds may be served,
properly balanced, in the course of a meal. A dinner of goulash, spoon
bread, creamed spinach and slaw topped by a meringue is far less
incongruous than a person in shorts on a Louis Quatorze sofa or Bach
brought up to date by a jazz band.

I like to think of menu suggestions in terms of a large Victorian hall
rack. On its pegs hang hats representing dishes. Perhaps they are
arranged to suit the diner’s taste; if not, they may be readily
rearranged to better advantage.

The general scheme suggested is a pattern planned to serve as a guide.
To accommodate your budget or your larder you may decide to replace a
top hat with a visored cap, a bit of evening frivolity with a garden hat
and so on. The frame work remains intact whatever you do. The mirror
reflects the household, its manners and mode of living. Re-arrange the
following headgear to suit yourself.


                            Breakfast Menus

To balance the New Englander’s codfish balls and baked beans, the
Southerner’s grits and bacon and the Northerner’s fried cakes and
doughnuts, there is the modern trend to make the first meal of the day
as light as possible. Today the average woman’s breakfast is probably:
Fruit, dry toast, a beverage, and the average man’s is: Fruit, cereal,
eggs with ham or bacon, hot bread and a beverage.

The following suggestions are offered to vary the monotony of these
menus:

                                   1

La Brinvilliers, a notorious poisoner, was beheaded for her crimes.
According to a French wit, the only difference between La Brinvilliers
and the average cook is the intention.

grievously, but at a “help yourself” party she may give her fancy free
reign and let her guests assume full responsibility.

                             Table Setting


When setting a table give your guests plenty of elbow room. Do not
{pg 803}crowd them.

If preferred the napkin may be placed to the left and the first course,
on a plate or in a cocktail glass, may be placed on the service plate
before the guests are seated. In winter it is unwise to do this if you
wish to begin with a hot dish as some guests suddenly become sociable
and the short delay occasioned in seating them may chill the soup or
entrée. (The host is frequently given to transgressing in this way.)

The first course, cocktail, soup or hors d’œuvre, is removed with the
service plate. The waitress removes the service plate with the left hand
and replaces it with a hot plate from the right hand.

There is a plate before the guest throughout a formal meal except for
the few moments before the dessert course when the table is denuded of
all plates, salt and pepper containers, unused silver and used wine
glasses (if you have ceased to serve the wine).

The table is then brushed free of crumbs. A small square pad about 8 x 8
inches is covered with a piece of linen. This usually has a small lace
or tatted edge. The waitress places the covered pad flat on her hand and
the dish to be served is placed on the pad. When she is ready to remove
the crumbs from the table she uses another covered pad (oblong, about 4
x 8 inches) to brush the crumbs onto the first pad. (Folded napkins may
be substituted.) The formal dessert setting is then placed before the
guests. If you wish to serve finger bowls, place a small fine doily on
the dessert plate and the partly filled finger bowl upon the doily. The
dessert fork and spoon are placed to either side of the finger bowl. The
guest places the fork and spoon to either side of the plate and removes
the finger bowl, with the doily, to the left.

If several wines are to be served the glasses needed for this purpose
are placed on the table from the beginning. When you have ceased to
serve a particular wine the glass is removed.

Ash trays are frequently used during a meal, so they may be placed on
the table at once. Smoking between courses is frowned upon by all
epicures because it deadens the sensitivity of the palette, but guests
must be permitted to do what pleases them. Sometimes ash trays are
placed before guests before the dessert plates are brought in.

After-dinner coffee may be served at table. It is frequently poured by
the hostess. Coffee spoons are placed on the saucers behind the cups.
The filled cups and cream and sugar are passed by the waitress. Or, if
the dinner has reached an informal stage, the hostess may ask the
guests’ preference and add the sugar and cream, if desired. (Cream, by
the way, is optional).

Experience has taught me that men in particular like to loiter at table;
being left to their own conversation (and a bottle of port) is dear to
them. The hostess may serve coffee and somewhat later retire to the
drawing room with the women guests, or she may serve the coffee to her
reassembled guests in the drawing room. By this time good food, wine and
conviviality have usually broken down the minor social inhibitions and
the serving of coffee may be informal. Liqueur may be served in the wake
of coffee.

Formal dinners, given in beautifully appointed houses, served by
competent, well trained servants (who are artists in their own right),
are a treat.

Since we cannot expect to have these ideal conditions at all times in
{pg 804}the average house, why make an attempt at undue formality? At a
formal dinner one waiter usually serves six people, no more. When a
party is larger, additional service is required. If you cannot meet
these requirements, make your dinner less formal by all means. Your
chances for success will be greater if you do not attempt the impossible
and your standards need not be lowered in the least.

Plan to have an ordered, well-cooked meal (you may have to cook and
serve it yourself). For this, immaculate linen and sparkling glass and
silver are imperative. Plan to have the kind of food that will simplify
last-minute preparation and subsequent serving. Plan to have few courses
and to serve more than one kind of food from one platter.

Please do not let your guests sit, trying to make conversation, with a
gradually congealing slice of meat before them, waiting longingly for
the vegetables and the reluctant gravy boat to follow. This is trying to
hostess and guests alike.

If service is indifferent, or if your harassed cook is to pinch hit as a
waitress, plan to serve the main course yourself from an attractively
arranged platter, let us say a baked fish, parsley potatoes and tomatoes
filled with peas, with the gravy boat next to the platter. Or, if you
prefer, have the platter passed and follow it up quickly with the gravy
boat.

Once filled plates are before the guests, a waitress is free to pass
bread, condiments, to refill water glasses or to serve wine (unless the
host prefers to do this himself from a decanter or bottle).

If a little common sense is applied in advance planning there should be
no objectionable creaking of the household machinery and both hosts and
guests should be at their ease. Entertaining will prove to be the
pleasure it is supposed to be if you are not too ambitious in the wrong
direction.

_Advice To An Untried Hostess_ (soon to be much tried if she allows
herself to become flustered).

No matter whom you are entertaining try not to be unduly impressed with
the fact that something unusual is expected of you as a hostess. It
isn’t. Distinguished persons are usually simple. They dislike
ostentation and nothing is more disconcerting to a guest than the
impression that his coming is causing a household commotion. Confine all
noticeable efforts for his comfort and entertainment to the period that
precedes his arrival. Work like a demon, if you must, satisfy yourself
that you have anticipated every known emergency (the howling child, the
last-minute search for studs, your husband’s exuberance, your cook’s ill
humor) and then relax and enjoy your guests.

If something happens to upset your well-laid plans, rise to the
occasion. The mishap may be the making of your party. Capitalize on it,
but not too heavily.

Poise is an admirable quality. “Saki” advises us to observe the dignity
and the grace of a cat, which he thinks equalled in only a few fortunate
human beings. As a cat is not called upon to be a cook (or a hostess)
she may well have poise.

Poise is more difficult to attain and sustain when a woman must emulate
the mental and physical agility of a flea. Sometimes it takes a
super-human effort to fling aside her kitchen apron as the door bell
rings announcing the arrival of the first guests, and to assume a manner
devoid of exhaustion or concern when greeting them. But the average
woman, who is frequently endowed with tact, grace and other good
qualities derived {pg 805}from her precious American heritage of
hospitality, is capable of this effort and makes it successfully.

_That which thy fathers have bequeathed to thee, earn it anew if thou
{pg 806}wouldst possess it._

                               screw.
_To Keep a Bowl Steady when    Place it on a wet folded cloth.
  Whipping Ingredients:_
_To Measure Fat:_              Solid fat may be measured by submerging in
                               water. If ⅓ cupful of fat is desired, fill
                               a cup ⅔ full of water, then submerge the
                               fat until the water reaches the one cup
                               mark. The water may then be poured off and
                               fat removed from the cup without sticking.
_To Clean a Burnt or a Greasy  Place 1 inch of water in the pot, add 1
  Pan Quickly:_                teaspoonful or more soda and heat the water
                               to the boiling point.
_Canned Shrimp:_               Canned shrimp are improved if soaked in ice
                               water for 1 hour.
_Evaporated Milk:_             Substitute ½ cup evaporated milk and ½ cup
                               water for 1 cup fresh milk.

  Recipe:_                     or other seasonings. Use seasoning
                               sparingly at first. Add what is needed
                               later. This calls for tasting.
_To Blanch Almonds:_           Pour boiling water over shelled almonds,
                               permit them to stand until the brown skin
                               is loosened, then blanch the almonds by
                               pulling it off.
                               Soak blanched almonds in cold water in the
                               refrigerator to whiten.
_To Freshen French or Italian  Let cold water run over them a second, then
  Bread or Hard Rolls:_        place in a moderate oven until crisp again.
                               Cool before slicing.
_To Preserve the Vitamins in   Keep milk out of sunlight to prevent
  Milk:_                       deterioration of its vitamins.
_Avoid Stirring Food           Avoid stirring air into cooking or hot
  Unnecessarily:_              food. Permit food to cool before putting it
                               through a strainer. Oxygen destroys some
                               nutritive elements.
_To Treat New Skillets and     Grease them well, place them in a hot oven
  Pans:_                       450° for about 30 minutes. Scour them well
                               with steel wool.

  from Boiling over While      the water.
  Cooking:_
_To Melt Sweet Chocolate for   Melt in a little strong coffee instead of
  Desserts:_                   water.
_To Season Foods:_             Add a bit of grated lemon rind and juice to
                               practically anything.
_On Steaks, Ham or Hamburger:_ Put some prepared mustard on steaks, ham,
                               in hamburgers, in dressing, in stuffing and
                               in vegetable butter.
_To Make Rice White and        Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice to each quart of
  Fluffy:_                     water while cooking.
_Use Kitchen Shears:_          To cut chives and tarragon instead of
                               chopping them. When chopped half their
                               flavor is lost. Use shears also to cut
                               parsley, dice cooked meats, dice giblets,
                               cut crusts from bread, cut marshmallows,
                               celery, etc. Dip shears in flour before
                               cutting marshmallows.
_To Remove Odors from Jars and Pour a solution of water and dry mustard
  Bottles:_                    into them and let stand for several hours,
                               or use a dilute chlorine solution, then
                               rinse in hot water.
_Use Grated Rind of Lemon or   To flavor orange or lemon desserts. Be
  Orange:_                     careful not to grate too deep. The colored
                               part imparts the flavor, the white part
                               makes food taste bitter.
_To Mix Liquid and Flour with  Put in small jar, cover and shake until the
  which to Thicken Sauces:_    ingredients are blended. Use the amount
                               needed. Keep the remainder in a cold place
                               for future use.
_To Melt Chocolate:_           Grease pot in which it is to be melted.
_To Measure Molasses:_         Grease cup in which it is to be measured.
_To Butter Bread:_             Cream butter that is to be spread on
                               sandwiches.
_In Damp Weather:_             Add cornstarch or a few grains of rice to
                               salt in shakers.
_Scalding Milk:_               Rinse a pan in cold water before scalding
                               milk to prevent sticking.
_To Peel Pears or Peaches      Scald the fruit with boiling water. Slip
  Quickly:_                    off the skins.
_To Roll Cereals or Crumbs     Place them between sheets of waxed paper or
  Quickly:_                    folds of a towel, then roll them.
_Avoid Smoking Fat:_           Fat should never be allowed to smoke or it
                               will form indigestible acids.
_To Remove Ink Stains from     Use milk.
  Carpets and other Fabrics:_
_For Quick Breakfasts:_        Many precious minutes may be saved during
                               the breakfast rush if dry ingredients for
                               muffins or pancakes are mixed the night
                               before (and muffin tins greased).
_To Handle Pie Dough:_         A good way to handle pie dough is to place
                               it on waxed paper. Gather up the paper into
                               a bag and manipulate the dough through the
                               paper until it forms a ball and is well
                               blended.

be room to include these marvelous rules. You may never discard the old
methods of baking cakes that have brought you fine results in the past,
but to be forward-looking, alert and in step with the spirit of the
times you should approach all culinary innovations with an open mind, or
in this case with an open mouth.

On page 538 you will find several forerunners of the cakes of today. Hot
Milk Cake on page 536 might also come under this heading. These cakes
share the advantages of the new rules, so it might be well to bear them
in mind. However, the following recipes have been worked out more
scientifically and to the dot. This is always a help to the timorous
beginner who feels sometimes as though she were concocting a bombshell
(little knowing that, if she is careless, her concoction may be
incapable of exploding even itself.)

                 *        *        *        *        *

Among my many fan letters I enjoyed the following:

    “Dear Madam:—

    “I think it is very wrong of you to encourage people during this
    war scarcity to waste good materials. My sponge cake did not
    rise one-half inch.

                                              “Disgustedly yours,
                                                         A Bride.”

Poor child! I could not answer her letter, as it was anonymous, but I
ached over her “newness” and my inability to come to her assistance.
After recovering from the insult to my never-fail (?) sponge cake, I
should like to have said to her much in the words of Noel Coward’s
spirit medium—“My dear, you are throwing up the sponge when you should
be casting down the gauntlet!”

Well, in this case the gauntlet has been thrown and all you have to do
is to try out the modern cakes without the least sense of conflict.

                 *        *        *        *        *

The advantages of the new method are the following:

I. All ingredients are placed in one bowl.

II. They are then beaten by hand or by an electric mixer for a stated
time.

III. As the mixing period is short, about four minutes in all, the
method is time as well as laborsaving.

IV. There is one important rule to follow to the letter. Milk, eggs and
shortening must be _at room temperature_. Take these ingredients from
the refrigerator two hours before they are used. If in haste, the milk
may be placed in a receptacle in warm water until it is lukewarm to the
touch. The eggs may be placed directly in warm water until they are no
longer cold to the touch. The shortening may be worked until it is
pliable but still firm. It must never be oily or melted. Be sure to use
a good grade of vegetable shortening of the emulsifier type.

IV. If the rules are followed closely the results are eminently
satisfactory. {pg 814}

                        QUICK METHOD WHITE CAKE

Have shortening, milk and eggs at room temperature. Have the oven
preheated to 350°. Prepare your cake pans (see below).

Place a flour sifter on a sheet of stiff paper or plate. Put into it:

    2¼ cups previously sifted cake flour
     5 teaspoons tartrate or phosphate baking powder or 4 teaspoons
       combination type (see Baking Powder, page 447).
     1 teaspoon salt
    1½ cups sugar

Measure into a cup:

     1 cup skimmed milk
     1 teaspoon vanilla
     ¼ teaspoon almond extract (optional)

Place in a bowl:

     ½ cup vegetable shortening (emulsifier type)

Beat this until it is pliable. Sift the dry ingredients from the sifter
into the bowl. Don’t forget to add the flour on the plate or paper. Add:

     ¾ cupful of the liquid ingredients

Mix these ingredients until the flour is dampened, then beat them for 2
minutes by the clock. If beating by hand, allow 150 strokes per minute;
if by electric mixer, run it at slow to medium speed. You may stop to
rest, but don’t forget your count. Allow full beating time. Scrape the
sides of the bowl frequently. Add the remaining milk and:

     4 large or 5 small unbeaten egg whites

Beat the mixture as before for 2 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl
frequently.

Have your pans ready, lightly greased with shortening and the bottoms
lined with waxed paper. Grease the top of the paper lightly. Bake the
batter in two round 8 inch pans or a 9 x 12 inch pan about 2 inches high
in a 350° oven for 30 to 35 minutes.

Permit the cake to remain in the pan for 1 or 2 minutes. Run a knife
around the edge. Invert the cake onto a cake rack. Remove the waxed
paper. Permit the cake to cool before icing it as desired. (See Icings,
page 613).

The recipes in this book call for standard measuring cups and spoons.
{pg 822}A standard measuring cup equals ½ pint. All measurements given
are level.

             A few grains          =       Less than ⅛ teaspoon
           1 teaspoon              =     ⅓ tablespoon
           1 tablespoon            =     3 teaspoons
           4 tablespoons           =     ¼ cup
           1 gill                  =     ½ cup
         5 ⅓ tablespoons           =     ⅓ cup

          16 ounces                =     1 pound
           1 fluid ounce           =     2 tablespoons
          16 fluid ounces          =     1 pint (2 cups)


              FOR USE IN TRANSLATING FOREIGN MEASUREMENTS

                           TRANSCRIBER NOTES

Misspelled words and printer errors have been corrected. Where multiple
spellings occur, majority use has been employed.

‘Cupfuls’ versus ‘cupsful’ is consistently and extensively used
throughout.

“Jambolaya”: this spelling used in the cookbook reflects the author’s
attention to culinary history. The first recipe for “Jam Bolaya” was
published in 1878 in “The Gulf City Cookbook” by the Ladies of the St.
Francis Street Methodist Episcopal Church, South Mobile, Alabama. It
became “Jambolaya” in the 1893 cookbook “Favorite Dishes. A Columbian
Autograph Souvenir.” and later settled to the current spelling of
“Jambalaya”.

Punctuation has been maintained except where obvious printer errors
occur.

Some illustrations were moved to facilitate page layout. Recipes have
been presented in a single column versus the original double column for
easier use on e-readers.
