Q: My fried foods are very greasy and soggy.
A: There are two reasons why your fried foods might
be soggy and more oily than expected. First, the
temperature of the frying fat may be too low. If the oil is
not hot enough, the fried item will retain more oil. It is also
possible the item was not drained properly after frying.
Immediately transfer fried items to a towel-­lined sheet
tray or a metal rack set inside a sheet tray.
Q: My fried foods are golden brown and crispy on the
exterior, but still raw in the center.
A: Your frying oil may be too hot, meaning the exterior
cooks before the rest of the item has time to cook
through. If it is possible to lower the temperature, try
it. As an alternative, you can place the cooked item
in a 350°F/176°C oven to finish cooking. Use a probe
thermometer to check the internal temperature
before serving.

CHAPTER 19

DEEP FRYING
Creating crunchy, crusty foods,
deep frying is a staple of any
restaurant. From quick-service
favorites like French fries or hush
puppies to delicate tempura and
crisp high-end garnishes, deep frying
ensures golden brown foods with an
appealing texture.

Deep frying is a method of cooking foods by submerging them in hot oil. The food is almost
always coated with a breading, batter, or simple flour coating. The coating acts as a barrier
between the fat and the food and contributes flavor and texture.
• Foods must be trimmed and cut into a uniform size and shape to ensure rapid and
even cooking. Select cuts that are naturally tender; some typical choices include poultry,
seafood, and vegetables. Remove the skin and bones of poultry and fish fillets if necessary
or desired. All vegetables must be thoroughly rinsed, and in some cases scrubbed. Trim
away tough or inedible skins, peels, cores, seeds, and roots.
• Deep frying is also suitable for croquettes and similar dishes made from a mixture of
cooked, diced meats, fish, or poultry, bound with a heavy béchamel and breaded.
• Standard breading can be done 20 to 25 minutes ahead and the items refrigerated
before frying, but ideally breading should be done as close to service as possible. A batter
or plain flour coating is applied immediately before cooking.
• To develop additional flavor, season the item with additional ingredients prior to deep
frying. Herbs and dried spices can be added to the coating or batter used to cover the item.
• There are two primary methods for deep frying: the swimming method and the basket
method. The choice between the two methods of deep frying depends on the food, the
coating, and the intended result.
• The swimming method of frying is generally used for battered food. To coat prepped food
with batter, dust it first with flour, then shake off the excess before dropping it into the
batter. Remove the food with tongs and briefly let any
excess batter drip off. Carefully lower the battered food
halfway into the hot oil with the tongs, or with your
fingers, using extra caution. When it starts to bubble,
release it; it will not sink.
• The basket method is generally used for breaded
items. Place the breaded food in a frying basket and
then lower both the food and the basket into the hot fat.
Once the food is cooked, use the basket to lift out the
food. Foods that would tend to rise to the surface too
rapidly are held down by setting a second basket on top
of the food; this is known as the double-­basket method.
• Choose oils and other cooking fats for frying that can
reach a high temperature without smoking or breaking
down. Vegetable oils, including corn, canola, and
safflower, have neutral flavors and high smoke points.
Special oils may be used for a specific flavor. Olive oil
or rendered duck or goose fat may be appropriate.
• Electric or gas deep fryers with baskets are typically
used for deep frying, although it is also feasible to
fry foods on the stovetop in a large pot. The sides
should be high enough to prevent fat from foaming
over or splashing, and the pot wide enough to allow the
chef to add and remove foods easily. Use a deep-­fat
frying thermometer to check the fat’s temperature,
regardless of whether you use a fryer or a pot.
498 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

• Become familiar with the fryer’s recovery time: the time needed for the fat to regain the
proper temperature after food is added. The fat will lose temperature for a brief time when
food is added. The more food, the more the temperature will drop and the longer it will take
to come back to the proper level.
• Kitchens that must fry many kinds of food often have several fryers to help prevent
flavor transfer. Have a pan lined with paper towels to blot fried foods before they are
served. Tongs, spiders, and baskets help add foods to the fryer and remove them when
properly cooked.

FAT FOR DEEP FRYING
Choosing the right frying oil depends on many factors, but one of the most important
considerations is the oil’s smoke point. The smoke point is the highest temperature that
the oil can reach before it starts to smoke. It will in fact begin to decompose well before that
point. The higher the smoke point, the better the fry.
Frying is a method of direct-­heat cooking, since the hot oil will come in contact with whatever
product is being fried. The temperature of the oil is well above the temperature of boiling
water, and therefore it can cook a lot faster. This form of cooking will dry the surface of
the food, crisp it, and brown it, while cooking it internally as well, practically sealing the
moisture in.
Some commonly used oils with high smoke points are as follows:
• Canola oil (400°F/204°C)
• Low acidity extra-­virgin olive oil (high quality) (405°F/207°C)
• Sesame oil (410°F/210°C)
• Cottonseed oil (420°F/216°C)
• Peanut oil (440°F/227°C)
• Sunflower oil (440°F/227°C)
• Soybean oil (495°F/257°C)
• Safflower oil (520°F/266°C)
Any of these oils will work in a fryer, since you will rarely have to fry anything above
375°F/190°C. There are two questions to consider. Which one is the best for the food and
how much does it cost? If food cost is not an issue, the best choice is peanut oil, since it
produces the crispiest fried food that stays that way longer. But, when taking food cost into
consideration, use canola oil or sunflower oil for frying, since it will not only produce a crisp
fried product but is also much more economical than peanut oil. Stay away from extra-­virgin
olive oil and sesame oil, since they impart their flavor to the foods as they are frying, unless
that is the desired effect.

not cover fried foods if they need to be held for a short period of time; hold
in dry heat on an open rack.

Preserving the Flavor from Deep-­
Fried Foods
Because no juices are released and a larger amount of oil is involved, there is no
fond or pan drippings resulting from deep-­fried foods. Sauces accompanying
deep-­fried foods are usually made separately.

Quality Criteria for Deep-­Fried Foods
Properly deep-­fried foods will:
• have a golden-­brown exterior that is crisp and crunchy, not soggy.
• not be greasy or oily in either appearance or mouthfeel.
• have a moist, tender interior that is cooked to the appropriate doneness.

A: The oil is likely too hot, so the exterior cooks before the heat reaches the
interior. Adjust the oil temperature, using the exterior of your item as a visual
indicator. For larger items, like bone-­in chicken, you may need to transfer the
food to an oven to finish cooking through.
Q: My cooked fried foods don’t appear burned, but they have a slightly
bitter, burned flavor.
A: The frying oil is probably old and ready to be replaced. As oil is re-­used, small
particles of food or breading fall into the oil and burn, which in turn, adds an off
flavor to oil. To extend the life of your frying oil, you can strain in between uses.
A good rule of thumb: If you can smell the oil, it should probably be replaced.
Q: Deep fried items are soggy and greasy.
A: Soggy or greasy foods are generally a result of oil that is not hot enough.
This can happen for several reasons: The temperature of the oil was simply
not hot enough and needs to be increased; the pan was overcrowded, lowering
the temperature of the oil; frozen foods were added to the oil, causing the
temperature to drop suddenly.

CHAPTER 20

STEAMING
Sometimes thought of as a gentle
cooking technique, steaming is
actually a very quick and efficient
way to cook naturally tender foods.
Imparting very little flavor of its own,
this technique showcases the natural
flavors of fresh foods without the
need for many added fats or heavy
seasoning.

Steamed foods are cooked in a closed cooking vessel surrounded by water vapor. Steaming is
an efficient and highly effective way to prepare naturally tender fish, poultry, and vegetables.
Steam circulating around the food provides an even, moist environment.
• Steamed foods often retain more intrinsic flavor than foods cooked by other methods
because the cooking medium does not generally impart much flavor of its own. They are
generally considered to have better nutritional value as well.
• The best foods for steaming are naturally tender and of a size and shape that allow them
to cook in a short amount of time. Cut food into the appropriate size, if necessary.
• Fish is generally cooked as fillets, though there are some typical presentations of whole
fish. Similarly, boneless, skinless poultry breasts (suprêmes) steam well. Shellfish can be
left in the shell, unless otherwise indicated; for example, scallops are customarily removed
from the shell. Shrimp may also be peeled before steaming. All vegetables should be
properly rinsed or scrubbed, peeled, trimmed, and cut to shape as close to the time of
service as reasonable.
• Many different liquids are used for steaming. Water is common, but a flavorful broth or
stock, court bouillon, wine, or beer can also be used, especially if the steaming liquid is
served along with the food.
• Adding aromatic ingredients such as herbs and spices, citrus zest, lemongrass, ginger,
garlic, and mushrooms to the cooking liquid boosts its flavor as well as that of the food
being steamed. Sometimes food is steamed on a bed of vegetables in a closed vessel; the
vegetables’ natural moisture becomes part of the steam bath cooking the food.
• Fillings, marinades, and wrappers can all be used in preparing steamed foods. Fish is
sometimes wrapped in this way to keep it exceptionally moist.
• Small amounts of food can be steamed using a small insert. Larger quantities, or foods
that require different cooking times, are better prepared in a tiered steamer. It is important
to allow enough room for steam to circulate completely around foods as they cook to
encourage even, rapid cooking.

516 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

Tiered steamer baskets may be made of bamboo or stainless steel. The tiered format allows for multiple ingredients to be cooked at one time
from the same heat source, as the layers are stacked one on top of another.

Adjust the heat to maintain even, moderate heat. Liquids do not need to be
at a rolling boil in order to produce steam. In fact, rapid boiling may cause
the liquid to cook away too fast. Replace the lid and steam until done.
Since steaming is done in a closed cooking vessel, it can be more difficult
than other methods to gauge how long food needs to cook. Recipes may

QUALITY CRITERIA FOR
STEAMED FOODS
Properly steamed foods will:
• have clean, clear flavors.
• be plump, moist, and tender; they generally do not lose much of their original volume.
• appear moist on the surface.
• retain their true, vibrant color.

PRESERVING THE FLAVOR
FROM STEAMED FOODS
Because it primarily cooks using hot water vapor, steaming itself does not add any flavors
to foods. At the same time, this means that the natural flavors and aromas of the food are
generally very well preserved, with no added fats or reactions to mask those characteristics.
Depending on the liquid used when steaming, and if it is flavorful, it may be possible to
repurpose it for steaming other items or as part of a soup or sauce base. If not using right
away, strain, cool, and refrigerate the liquid.

BEYOND THE BASICS
Cooking en Papillote

528 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

In this variation of steaming, which translates literally as “in paper,” the main
item and accompanying ingredients are wrapped in a parchment paper
package and cooked in the steam produced by their own juices. En papillote
indicates a specific preparation, but there are similar dishes, known by regional
names, throughout the world.

to gauge without experience, because you cannot open the package to see or
feel for doneness. If the food has been cut to the correct size or if it has been
partially cooked in advance, it should be done when the package is very puffy
and the paper is brown. Performing a few test runs of an en papillote dish will
help establish a reliable cooking time for the dish, provided that the ingredients
are consistently prepared beforehand.
Cooking en papillote, like steaming, is suited to naturally tender foods like
chicken, fish, and shellfish. Trim and portion food as required by the recipe.
It may be marinated or seared as an initial step, if appropriate. A marinade
can add flavor and color; searing helps to assure that thicker cuts cook more
quickly and deepens both the flavor and color of the seared item. Some foods
may be filled or stuffed.
Include vegetables for moisture as well as flavor, color, and texture. Cut the
vegetables small, usually into thin slices, a fine julienne, or tiny dice, and sweat
or blanch them, if necessary, to ensure that they will be fully cooked. Leave
herbs in sprigs, cut them into a chiffonade, or mince them. Also have available
a prepared sauce, reduced heavy cream, wine, or citrus juices as required by
the recipe.
To cook en papillote, you will need parchment paper (or other wrappers as
required by the recipe), sizzler platters or baking sheets, and service items. Cut
the wrapper large enough to allow the food and any additional ingredients to fit
comfortably without overcrowding.
As the package cools, it will begin to deflate, so serve en papillote dishes as
soon as possible. For a dramatic presentation, have the server cut open the
package in front of the guest.

chapter 20 • STEAMING | 529

Troubleshooting
Q: Finished foods are mushy and fall apart.
A: If finished foods appear soft or mushy, it is likely that the item cooked too
long. Steam is very hot and it cooks food quickly. Always ensure the steaming
liquid is at just a simmer, and adjust the heat as needed for even cooking. It is
also important to use a probe thermometer to check the internal temperature
of your foods, to prevent overcooking.
Q: When steaming multiple ingredients, some cook faster than others.
Certain items overcook while others are underdone.
A: Steaming cooks food very quickly, so minutes—­and sometimes even
seconds—­can count. Ingredients that will require the longest cooking time
should be placed in the steamer first, with additional items added based on
their approximate cooking time. Foods that require more cooking time will be
larger in size, more dense, or lower moisture foods. Tender fish and vegetables
will cook quickly, and can be added later. Remember that every time the lid is
removed, hot air escapes, so avoid opening the steamer as much as possible.

BRAISING AND
STEWING
For succulent short ribs and melt-inyour-mouth beans, look to braising
and stewing. Braised and stewed
items can be prepared ahead and
are often more flavorful the next
day, making them an invaluable and
efficient menu addition.

Braising is a technique that simmers food in liquid to produce a tender main
item and rich accompanying sauce. Stewing is similar to braising, except it
cooks bite-size pieces of food in liquid to produce a tender and highly flavored
dish that may include a combination of meat, poultry, seafood, or a variety of
vegetables in an aromatic sauce. Ingredients cook in their natural juices which,
along with the cooking liquid, turn into a well-developed sauce—full of flavor
and depth. The two techniques share many basic concepts.
Stews are excellent make-­ahead dishes.
They can be made ahead of time, cooled,
and frozen for service at a later stage.
Main items should always be stored in
the sauce to prevent drying out.

• The flavor in a braise or stew comes from the main ingredient, the aromatic
vegetables, and the cooking liquid.
• Tough cuts of meat become tender as the moist heat gently penetrates the
meat and causes the connective tissues to soften. The less tender cuts of meat
to be braised or stewed come from more mature and more exercised animals.
These cuts are more deeply flavored than the tender foods used for sautéing
and steaming. Trim meats of exterior and interior fat, gristle, and sinew.
• Tender foods, even delicate fish and shellfish, can also be braised or
stewed. To properly cook these kinds of foods, use less cooking liquid and
cook the food at a lower temperature for a shorter period of time.
• Searing is often the first step when braising or stewing. Brown the item
in hot fat to the desired color, then simmer it in a covered vessel in stock or
another cooking liquid.

When cooking for special diets, there is
a whole range of delicious and healthy

• The cooking liquids usually consist of rich stock or a combination of a
stock and a sauce (such as espagnole, demi-­glace, or velouté) suited to the

just a few examples that work well—­
especially if they complement the stew
you’re making.

• Acidic ingredients such as tomatoes or wine are often added to a braise. In
addition to deglazing the pan and releasing the fond, the liquid and/or acid
helps to soften the tough tissues of some braised foods and adds a desirable
flavor and color to the finished dish. Tomato concassé, tomato purée, or
tomato paste can all be used.
• Aromatic vegetables, or herbs, are sometimes added for more flavor.
If they are to be strained out of the sauce or puréed and added back to
the sauce, uniform cuts are not so important. However, when aromatic
ingredients will be used as a garnish in the finished dish, they should be
peeled, cut to a uniform size and shape, and added to the dish in the proper
sequence so that all components finish cooking at the same time.
• Season foods for stewing or braising before cooking, using salt, pepper,
marinades, or dry rubs to give the finished dish a complex and dynamic flavor.
Prepare a sachet d’épices or bouquet garni including spices, herbs, and other
aromatic ingredients as desired or required by the recipe. A whole garlic head can
be roasted with a little oil and added to give a deeper, sweeter flavor to the dish.
• Some braised or stewed vegetable dishes include a pork product (salt
pork, bacon, or ham) or an acid (vinegar, citrus zest or juice, or wine) to
develop a complex flavor.
• Long simmering times reduce the volume of liquid and make relatively
small amounts of seasoning more intense. Taste and adjust seasoning
throughout the entire cooking process.

536 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

• To thicken the braising or stewing liquid, use roux, roux-­thickened sauces, reductions,
beurre manié, or a pure starch slurry. Flour may be added either by dusting the main item
or by adding it directly to the pan with the aromatic vegetables. Mirepoix may also be
puréed and added back to the sauce to thicken it. It is also possible to finish a sauce with
cream, herbs, or a liaison of eggs and cream.
• Vegetable purées can effectively thicken your sauce and can add extra nutritional
benefits to your dish. But, choose your vegetable carefully, because the purée will change
the flavor of your dish.
• Choose a heavy-­gauge braising pan or rondeau with a tight-­fitting lid of a size and shape
that best fits the ingredients for slow, even cooking.

A heavy-­bottomed rondeau with a tight-­fitting lid is best for braising
and stewing.

BRAISING

Braising is a technique that simmers food in liquid to produce a tender main item and rich
accompanying sauce.
• The amount of liquid used in the braise is crucial to the success of the finished dish. Be
sure to have enough liquid to keep the food moistened throughout the cooking time and to
produce an adequate amount of sauce to serve with the finished item. Typically, one-­third
to one-­half of the main item should be submerged in the cooking medium.
• Braised foods are often left in a single large piece that can be sliced or carved. It’s a good
idea to truss or tie the meat in order to maintain the proper shape.
• Food may be wrapped in cabbage leaves or other coverings to help maintain the shape
and prevent the food from breaking apart during cooking.
• The sauce for the braise may be served unstrained, containing ingredients that are
cooked along with the main item, such as potatoes and other vegetables. In other
instances, the sauce is strained before it is served and any additional finishing or garnishing
ingredients are added just before serving.

Braise until the main item is fully cooked and tender. Establish a slow

medium-­low oven (approximately 275° to 325°F/135° to 163°C) or over
low direct heat. Stir, skim, and adjust the seasoning and amount of liquid
throughout the cooking time. Baste or turn the foods from time to time to
keep all surfaces evenly moistened with the cooking liquid. This helps to
ensure that the food cooks evenly.
Remove the lid during the final part of the cooking time. This will cause
the cooking liquid to reduce adequately so that the sauce will have a good
consistency and flavor. Also, if the main item is turned frequently after the
lid has been removed and is thus exposed to hot air, a glaze will form on
the surface, providing a glossy sheen and good flavor. Fork-­tender braised
foods slide easily from a kitchen fork or may be cut with the side of a fork.

Even though carryover cooking is not as big a factor for these dishes as it is for roasts, grills, and sautés, it is still
easier to carve foods after they are allowed to rest for several minutes. Transfer the main item to a pan and keep it
warm while finishing the sauce.
The braise may be cooled rapidly and stored in the refrigerator for later use, if desired. Add any final finishing or
garnishing ingredients just before serving the braise.

Quality Criteria of Braised Foods
Properly braised foods will:
• be tender, moist, and properly browned.
• have a color that is even and deep.
• have a complex and well-­developed flavor and aroma.

STEWING
Stewing cooks bite-­size pieces of food in liquid to produce a tender and highly flavored “one-­dish meal” that may include a
combination of meat, poultry, seafood, or a variety of vegetables in an aromatic sauce.
• Tough meat, firm vegetables, roots, and beans slowly
break down and become tender.
• Some stews call for the main meat or poultry to be
dusted with flour and then cooked in hot oil just until it
starts to stiffen, with no browning. This is often true of
light-­colored stews, like blanquettes. Other stews call
for the main item to be cooked to a deep brown. Once
the meat, poultry, or fish is properly colored, remove
it from the pan and keep it warm while sweating,
smothering, or browning the aromatic vegetables, if
required.
• Trim meats of exterior and interior fat, gristle, and
sinew. Divide larger cuts along seam lines to make it
easier to cut across the grain for a more tender finished
stew. The size of the cut will vary according to the style
of stew, but typically they are 1 in/2.5 cm cubes. If they
are cut too small, too much of the surface area will be
exposed and the item will dry out.
• The amount of liquid required varies from one cut of
meat or poultry to another. Delicate or tender foods, such
as fish, shellfish, or vegetables may require very little
added moisture to stew successfully. Long simmering
times reduce the volume of liquid and make relatively
small amounts of seasoning more intense. Taste and
adjust seasoning throughout the entire cooking process.

540 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

• Stewed vegetables literally cook in their own juices. Vegetables that do not
release a significant amount of liquid as they cook may need additional liquid
such as stock, wine, fumet, juice, or water.
• Vegetable stews may be composed of one main ingredient or a combination
of vegetables. Braised fennel, for example, contains a single main ingredient;
ratatouille is a stew that melds several different vegetables. A vegetable stew or
braise may also be garnished with breadcrumbs and cheese to create a gratin.

Skimming improves the flavor, color, and
texture of the finished dish by removing
impurities and particles. Keep a small
bowl nearby to hold the skimmed scum.

4

Finish the stewing liquid into a sauce, if needed. First, remove the solid
ingredients with a slotted spoon or skimmer, if possible, to prevent
overcooking. Moisten them with a little of the cooking liquid, cover, and
keep warm. Strain the sauce if necessary and thicken by reducing it over
direct heat. Add any additional thickeners, such as a prepared roux or
a starch slurry, and continue to cook, skimming as necessary, until the
sauce has good flavor and consistency.
Return the solid ingredients to the sauce and return the stew to a
simmer. Many stews include additional components, such as vegetables,
mushrooms, potatoes, or dumplings. When these ingredients are cooked
along with the main ingredient, their own flavors are improved as well as
the flavor of the entire stew.
Make the final adjustments to the stew’s flavor and consistency. Add
heavy cream or temper a liaison (see page 256) into the stew as a finishing
and enriching step. Adjust the consistency by additional simmering if
necessary. Season with salt, pepper, lemon juice, or other ingredients.
Add additional garnish ingredients to the stew either in batches or by
individual servings.

Quality Criteria for Stewed Foods
Properly stewed foods will:
• be tender and moist, but not mushy. Ingredients should retain their shape.
• have a rich, glossy, velvety sauce.
• be rich with layered flavor infused throughout every ingredient.

Preserving the Flavor from
Braised and Stewed Foods
During braising and stewing, flavor is released into the cooking liquid to become the
accompanying sauce; thus virtually all the flavor is retained. The sauce resulting from a stew
also has exceptional body, as the slow cooking breaks down the tough connective tissues and
causes them to transform into gelatin.
As the braised food rests, the sauce can be finished in a number of ways. Remove and
discard the sachet d’épices or bouquet garni, if used. Return the braising liquid to a simmer
and degrease the sauce by skimming away any surface fat. Once it reaches the correct
consistency, adjust seasoning as needed. Many braises include vegetables, potatoes, or other
components that are cooked along with the main item. Serve these sauces unstrained. In
other instances, the sauce is strained before it is served.
Any unused braising liquid can be used for other applications, including as the base for
another braise, stew, sauce, or soup. Discarded mirepoix or other strained flavorings can be
blended and used to thicken and flavor other dishes.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the cabbage leaves until pliable, about 5 minutes. Drain, rinse in
cold water, and drain once more. Remove the large vein from each cabbage leaf with a paring knife. Reserve under
refrigeration.

2

To make the filling, season the veal, pork, and beef with 1 tbsp/10 g salt and 1 tsp/2 g pepper.

3

Grind the seasoned meat through a coarse die of a meat grinder. Fold the onions into the ground meat and grind a
second time through the same die. (Chill the mixture if its temperature rises above 40°F/4°C.)

4

Working over an ice bath, add the cream and eggs to the meat mixture in a medium bowl. Use a rubber spatula to mix
until evenly blended. Fold in the bread crumbs. Season with the remaining salt and pepper and the nutmeg.

5

For each cabbage roll, dampen a 12-­in/30-­cm square of cheesecloth. Place the cheesecloth in an 8-­fl oz/240-­mL
round cup. Place two cabbage leaves in the cup, overlapping the leaves so that there are no open spaces. Place
4 oz/113 g of the meat mixture in the center of the leaves and wrap them around to enclose the filling. Twist the
excess cheesecloth to form each roll into a ball. Do not twist too hard or the cabbage leaves will rip. Remove the
cabbage rolls from the cheesecloth each time they are formed and gently place on a platter or in a hotel pan.

6

Place the mirepoix and bay leaf in a rondeau or brasier. Place the cabbage rolls seam side down on top of the
mirepoix. Add enough hot stock to come about halfway up the rolls and place the bacon on top of the cabbage rolls, if
desired. Bring the stock to a gentle simmer over medium-­low heat. Cover the pot and transfer to a 325°F/163°C oven.
Braise the cabbage rolls to an internal temperature of 160°F/71°C, 25 to 30 minutes.

7

Serve the cabbage rolls immediately with tomato sauce, or hold them hot for service.

NOTE: This dish differs from a typical braise because it is not served with the reduced cooking liquid; it is served with a separate sauce.

BEYOND THE BASICS
Troubleshooting
Problem: The main item has cooked for the time called for in the recipe, but it is still
tough and dry.
Solution: Like other low-­and-­slow cooking methods, the time it takes for a braised or stewed
item to be “done” depends on many variable conditions, like the size or shape of the item, the
cooking temperature, and even the cooking liquid. Recipes provide an estimate for time, but
a braise or stew is only ready when the ingredients are fully cooked to the appropriate texture
and flavor, and this can take more time than expected.
Problem: My braised meat is mushy and mealy.
Solution: It is likely your meat has overcooked. Check your items frequently, and remove
it when it is fork tender and still moist. Be sure to remove any items from the liquid before
you reduce it, since a well-­cooked piece of meat, for instance, will continue cooking as the
liquid simmers.
Problem: The finished sauce is bland and watery.
Solution: If you used a flavorful cooking liquid, it is likely the sauce needs more time to
reduce. This will remove excess water that has leeched from the meats or vegetables in your
dish, and concentrate the flavors in the sauce.

CHAPTER 22

SHALLOW
POACHING AND
PAN STEAMING
This quick-cooking method retains
the flavor, shape, color, and texture
of delicate foods. Aromatic cooking
liquids contribute additional flavor
that does not overwhelm.

Shallow poaching is a technique that cooks food partially submerged in liquid. During
shallow poaching, the pan is covered to capture some of the steam released by the liquid
during cooking, so shallow poached foods are cooked through a combination of steam and
simmering liquid.
• Naturally tender foods of a size and shape that allow for quick cooking work best for
shallow poaching. Fish, shellfish, and chicken breasts are among the most common
options for this cooking method. Trim the main item as appropriate. Remove bones or skin
from fish to make fillets or from poultry to make suprêmes or boneless, skinless breast
portions. Fish fillets may be rolled or folded around a stuffing to form paupiettes, with the
bone side of the fish showing on the exterior. Remove shellfish from the shell, if desired.
• For vegetables, shallow poaching is typically referred to as pan steaming. Usually the
liquid barely covers the vegetables, and most of the cooking occurs by steaming.
• Vegetables of virtually all sorts can be prepared by pan steaming. Inspect the vegetables
for quality and freshness. Rinse, trim, peel, and cut the vegetable as close to cooking
time as possible for the best flavor and nutrition. All cuts should be precise and uniform,
to ensure even cooking and the best flavor and texture in the finished dish. Hold cut
vegetables covered and refrigerated when necessary.

564 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

• Speed is a major advantage of this technique. Green vegetables, such as green beans,
that sometimes discolor when cooked in a covered pan are done quickly enough to retain a
bright color.
• Cut aromatics fine or mince them. Other ingredients to be served along with the sauce
as a garnish should be cut neatly into strips, dice, julienne, or chiffonade. These ingredients
are often sweated or parcooked first to develop the best possible flavor as well as to make
certain that all parts of the finished dish are fully cooked at the same time.
• The poaching and steaming liquid contributes flavor to the food as well as to the sauce
prepared from it. Choose rich broths or stocks and add wine, vinegar, or citrus juice as
appropriate. Aromatics, such as shallots and herbs, are added for more flavor.
• Sweeteners, including white or brown sugar, maple syrup, honey, and molasses, can be
added to glaze a pan-­steamed vegetable, if desired. If the cooking liquid will be used to
prepare a pan sauce, have on hand additional seasonings or garnishes, thickeners, cream,
or liaison, as indicated by the recipe.
• A significant amount of flavor is transferred from the food to the cooking liquid. For
maximum flavor, the cooking liquid (cuisson) is usually reduced and used as the base for a
sauce. Acids included in the cooking liquid give the sauce a bright, balanced flavor. Butter
can be easily emulsified in the sauce; beurre blanc (page 370) is often the sauce of choice
for shallow-­poached foods.
• A cuisson can also be used in a way that does not require reduction but as a broth-­type
liquid in which to serve the main item. This method is sometimes referred to as “à la nage.”
• Use a sautoir or other shallow cooking vessel, such as a hotel pan, to shallow poach and
pan steam. Select the pan or baking dish carefully; if there is too much or too little space
left around the food, it may over-­or undercook, or there may be too much or too little liquid
for the sauce.
• For shallow poaching, buttered or oiled parchment paper or a loose-­fitting lid is used
to cover the pan loosely as the food cooks. It traps enough of the steam to cook the
unexposed part of the food, but not so much that the cooking speed rises.
• Shallow poaching is an à la minute technique.

Quality Criteria of Shallow Poached Foods
Properly shallow poached foods will:
• be tender and moist.
• not be rubbery.
• have a flavorful cooking liquid that can be reduced for a sauce.

Preserving the Flavor from Shallow
Poached Foods
During cooking, the pan liquid is further flavored by the item being poached in it. Depending
on the desired result, the cooking liquid can be used to create a sauce to finish the
poached item.
A cuisson can also be used in a way that does not require reduction but as a broth-­type liquid
in which to serve the main item. This method is sometimes referred to as “à la nage.”
To make a beurre blanc: Reduce the cooking liquid until it is syrupy. It may be strained into a
separate pot at this point, if desired. With the reduced cooking liquid at a simmer, add pieces
of cold butter a few at a time. Keep the pan in motion as you add the butter, swirling it into the
sauce as it melts.
To make a sauce vin blanc: Reduce the cooking liquid and add the desired aromatics and an
appropriately flavored velouté. Strain the sauce if necessary and finish with cream or a liaison
and any additional garnishes.

Soak the chile in water for about 15 minutes to soften.

2

Combine the chile with the shallots, garlic, lemongrass, and turmeric in a blender and process to a fine paste, adding
water as needed to facilitate the blending.

3

Combine the tamarind pulp with the hot water until fully dispersed and strain through a fine-­mesh sieve. Discard the
solids and reserve the strained liquid.

4

In a wok or similar pan, sweat the spice paste in the oil over medium heat until all moisture is evaporated and the
solids begin to separate from the oil.

5

Add the coconut milk and the strained tamarind paste. Bring to a boil and adjust seasoning with salt.

6

Cut the fish into 3-­oz/85-­g pieces, season with salt, and poach very gently in the spiced coconut milk until the fish is
cooked and begins to flake upon gentle pressure, about 5 minutes. Serve in a bowl, on a bed of steamed rice.

BEYOND THE BASICS
Troubleshooting
Problem: There is very little cooking liquid left at the end of poaching, and the food seems dry.
Solution: Be sure your pan has a tight-­fitting lid. If the steam is not trapped in the pan, the items will cook unevenly and
may dry out. If you see the liquid is reducing too quickly, add more as the items poach.
Problem: The cuisson is too salty to reduce for a sauce.
Solution: The cooking liquid will take on a lot of flavor from the item being cooked, and if that item is particularly salty or
briny, it will impact the cooking liquid. The cuisson may simply be too salty to use a sauce, in which case it might be useful
to flavor a soup or braise. It is possible to save a salty cooking liquid by adding unsalted broths, juices, purées, or other
flavorings to dilute the mix.

2

Lightly butter a shallow pan and sprinkle evenly with the shallots. Place the parsley stems, chive stems, and
peppercorns on top. Place the paupiettes, seam side down, on the bed of shallots. Add the wine and fumet.

3

Bring the liquid to just under a simmer (160° to 180°F/71° to 82°C) over direct heat. Place a piece of buttered parchment
paper (cartouche) over the paupiettes to cover. Transfer the entire pan to a 300° to 325°F/149° to 163°C oven.

4

Poach until the trout flesh is opaque and gives under slight pressure, 10 to 12 minutes.

5

Transfer the paupiettes to a half hotel pan, add a small amount of the cuisson, cover with plastic wrap, and
hold warm.

6

Place the pan with the remaining cuisson over medium-­high heat, bring to a simmer, and reduce by two-­thirds.
Reduce the heat to medium, add the velouté, and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the cream and reduce to a nappé
consistency. Add lemon juice, if desired, and adjust seasoning with salt and white pepper.

7

Strain the sauce through a fine-­mesh sieve into a clean saucepan or bain-­marie large enough to hold the

Left: After the fillets are gently flattened between plastic wrap to ensure even cooking, pipe a cold
filling down the length of each fillet. Spread the filling evenly over the entire surface for paupiettes.
Fillings are optional, but if used, they should be kept very cold until cooked. Right: Fillings need to
be completely encased to ensure they will be fully retained during cooking and not leak out. The fish
is rolled completely around the filling before the paupiettes are transferred to a holding container

CHAPTER 23

DEEP POACHING,
SIMMERING, AND
BOILING
These moist-heat techniques cook
food quickly or gently, either alone or
as the first step in another cooking
technique, like grilling. Various liquids
can be used as a cooking medium for
endless combinations.

Deep poaching, simmering, and boiling are techniques that cook food completely submerged
in a liquid at a constant temperature. The aim of these techniques is the same—to produce
foods that are moist and extremely tender.

DEEP POACHING AND SIMMERING
• The distinguishing factors between deep poaching and simmering are differences
in cooking temperature and appropriate types of food. Deep poaching is done at a
lower temperature and is better suited to naturally tender cuts of meat, poultry, or fish.
Simmering occurs at slightly higher temperature, so that the tougher cuts can become
tender and moist during cooking.
• Items to be deep poached should be naturally tender; those to be simmered need not
be since the simmering process will tenderize them. Though portion-­size cuts are often
used—­chicken quarters, for example—­poached and simmered items also include dressed
fish, whole birds, or large pieces of meat.
• Wrap dressed fish in cheesecloth to protect it from breaking apart during cooking. Stuff
the poultry, if desired, and truss it to help retain its shape. Stuff meats, if desired, and tie
them to maintain their shape.
• The liquid used in deep poaching and simmering should be well flavored. For meat and
poultry, select a well-­developed stock of the appropriate flavor. For fish and shellfish, use
fish stock, fumet, wine, or a court bouillon.
• Aromatic ingredients such as herbs and spices, wine, vegetables, vegetable juices, or
citrus zest may be added to the cooking liquid to enhance the flavor of the finished dish.
The aromatics, seasonings, and flavorings should either bolster or complement the flavor
of the food in a balanced way.
• Deep-­poached and simmered foods are often served with a sauce that is prepared
separately. Poached salmon, for instance, is often served with a warm butter emulsion
sauce, such as béarnaise or mousseline.
• The pot used for deep poaching or simmering should hold the food, liquid, and aromatics
comfortably, with enough room to allow the liquid to expand as it heats. There should also
be enough space so that the surface can be skimmed if necessary throughout cooking.
• A tight-­fitting lid may be helpful for bringing the liquid up to temperature. Leaving a lid
on throughout the cooking process may actually cause the liquid to become hotter than
desired.

580 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

A fish poacher is an elongated pot used to poach whole fish or other oversized items, like terrines. It allows foods to cook evenly
using less liquid, resulting in a flavorful, less diluted broth that can be used to prepare an accompanying sauce.

Poach the food until properly done. Tests for doneness vary from one food
type to another. If a poached or simmered item is to be served cold, it
may be desirable to slightly undercook it. Remove the pot from the heat
and let the food cool in the poaching liquid, which will retain enough heat
to complete the cooking process. Cool the liquid in an ice water bath to
prevent bacterial growth. Once it has reached room temperature, remove
the food for any further preparation. The liquid may be used to poach or
simmer other items.

Boiling
Boiling is a fundamental cooking technique, primarily used for vegetables, that can result in a
wide range of textures and flavors, depending upon how the technique is applied. Vegetables
may be blanched, parcooked or parboiled, or fully cooked. Boiled vegetables can be served
chilled, added to another dish such as a stew to finish cooking, glazed or finished in butter or
oil, or used to make a purée. Almost all vegetables can be boiled, as long as the appropriate
modifications are made to the boiling process.
• Prepare vegetables for boiling by properly rinsing or scrubbing them to remove all traces
of dirt. They may be trimmed and cut before cooking, or they may be cooked whole,
according to the vegetable’s nature as well as the intended presentation. If the vegetable
has a tendency to turn brown once it is cut and exposed to the air (as artichokes do, for
instance), try to cut it immediately before cooking, or hold the vegetable submerged in
plain or acidulated water. However, extended storage in water, once vegetables are peeled
or cut, can rob them of flavor, texture, and nutritional value.
• Vegetables boiled whole or cut should be of a similar size, shape, and diameter to assure
even cooking.
• Water is the most commonly used liquid for boiling, though other liquids may be used
depending on the desired flavor of the finished dish. Adding salt and other seasonings to
the liquid enhances the flavor of a vegetable. Additional flavor and interest can be provided
with finishing and garnishing ingredients.
• Delicate green vegetables must be cooked in small
batches in heavily salted water that should never
stop boiling, and they must always be shocked in
ice water after cooking. If cooking a large volume of
green vegetables, cook them in batches so that the
water temperature has time to recover and is always
boiling. Adding salt to the water for parcooking green
vegetables boosts flavor and helps the water come up to
temperature faster and recover faster. When shocking
green vegetables, shock them in ice water. Dilute the
salt in a small amount of warm or hot water and then
add to ice water.
• Select the pot size in relation to the amount of food
being prepared. It should hold the vegetables, liquid, and
aromatics comfortably, with enough room for the liquid
to expand as it heats. Leave enough headspace for the
surface to be skimmed if necessary.
• A tight-­fitting lid is helpful for bringing the liquid up
to temperature, but it is not essential. Some green
vegetables, for example, will discolor if left covered
during the whole cooking process. Leaving a lid on
throughout the cooking process may shorten cooking
time, but be sure to check the vegetables periodically to
avoid overcooking them or discoloration.

584 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

• Season the cooking liquid and bring it to the proper cooking temperature
before adding the prepared vegetables. The amount of liquid required varies,
depending on the type and amount of vegetable and the length of cooking
time. In general, there should be enough water to hold the vegetables
comfortably, without excessive crowding. Add salt and any other seasonings
or aromatic ingredients to the liquid.
Determining doneness is a crucial aspect of all vegetable preparations, but it is
especially important in boiling, the most basic technique:
Blanched: Immerse vegetables briefly, usually 30 seconds to 1 minute,
depending on type of vegetable and ripeness, in boiling water to make
the skin easy to remove, to eliminate or reduce strong odors or flavors,
to set the color for serving cold, and/or as the first step in other cooking
techniques.
Parcooked/parboiled: Vegetables are cooked to partial doneness to
prepare them for finishing by grilling, sautéing, pan frying, deep frying,
or stewing.
Tender-­crisp or al dente: Cook vegetables until they can be bitten into
easily but still offer a slight resistance and sense of texture. (The term al

dente, which is Italian for “to the tooth,” is more accurately used to describe
the desired doneness of pasta rather than vegetables.)

Method in Detail
1

Bring the water to a rolling boil before adding most vegetables, except dense or starchy
root vegetables. (These vegetables, such as turnips and celeriac, are started in cold
water that is then brought to a boil for even cooking.) For the best color in red cabbage,
beets, and white vegetables, cover the pot after placing them in the boiling water. This
helps retain acids that set the color in these vegetables. Cover the pot when boiling
orange and yellow vegetables such as carrots and squash, if desired. Green vegetables,
such as broccoli, asparagus, or green beans, should be boiled uncovered to produce a
good green color in the cooked vegetable.
Once the vegetables are added to the pot, leave the heat on high to bring the water back
to a rapid boil and continue to cook the vegetables to the appropriate doneness.
Vegetables should be removed from the water either by draining off the cooking liquid
through a colander or sieve or by lifting the vegetables from the water with a spider
or skimmer.

2

Finish and season the vegetables now. They may also be rapidly chilled to stop any
further, to cool them for service in a cold dish, or to hold them for later service.

3

The procedure for cooling vegetables, sometimes referred to as shocking or refreshing,
is as follows: After you drain the vegetables, submerge them in very cold or ice water
long enough to cool them until they are thoroughly chilled. As soon as they are cool,
drain them again, place them in storage containers, cover, and refrigerate. Vegetables
should not be allowed to sit in water for extended periods of time.
Starchy vegetables with stable pigments, such as turnips, parsnips, or carrots, are
best cooled by spreading them out into a single layer and placing in a cool spot before
refrigerating.

Preserving the Flavor from Deep-­Poached,
Simmered, and Boiled Foods
During cooking, the pan liquid used for poaching and simmering is further
flavored by the item being cooked in it. Depending on the desired result,
the cooking liquid can be reduced and used to create a sauce to finish the
poached item.
If not being used for an accompanying sauce, the cooking liquid can be strained
and reserved to use again or incorporated into another dish.
In boiling, the cooking liquid, usually water, is typically discarded after use.
For vegetables:
• Green vegetables should be a deep
or bright green with no traces of gray
or yellow.
• White vegetables should be white or
ivory.
• Red vegetables should be deeper
in color; some take on a purple or
magenta color, but not blue or green.

Quality Criteria for Deep Poached,
Simmered, and Boiled Foods
Properly deep-­poached, simmered, and boiled foods will:
• be tender, yet still hold their original shape.
• have an appealing, even color appropriate to the item.
• have a good, fresh flavor that is enhanced, not overwhelmed, by ingredients
in the poaching or cooking liquid.

BEYOND THE BASICS
Sous Vide
Sous vide cooking is the application of heat to a food product that is vacuum-­sealed in a
virtually-­impervious-­to-­air plastic bag and cooked for a relatively long period of time at a
precise low temperature. This combination of factors allows the chef to achieve remarkable
results that can be reproduced efficiently at a high level of precision and accuracy.

Basic Food Science of Sous Vide Cooking
Low-­temperature cooking has long been established as the preferred method for tough
cuts of meat with large amounts of connective tissue. With proper temperature, applied in a
moist-­heat environment, all the fibrous tissue will slowly dissolve into gelatin and contribute
to a moist final product. This would normally entail cooking the product for a long period of
time and subjecting it to the degrading effects of oxidation as well as unsafe microbiological
conditions. So, typically, the traditional temperatures employed render the product safe but
also denature the muscle fibers, causing them to initially toughen and release all their water,
and thereby producing a dry and flavorless overcooked product with a poor nutritional profile.
But by precisely controlling the temperature in the sous vide process, the tough connective
tissue can be transformed, over time, into silky gelatin while the muscle fibers are not
denatured and all their inherent juices are retained. The environment within the bag also
eliminates oxidation and prevents any inherent moisture in the product from evaporating.

chapter 23 • DEEP POACHING, SIMMERING, AND BOILING | 595

This type of temperature control can be applied to red meats that require varying degrees
of doneness as well. Certain protein-­tenderizing enzymes, naturally found in the tissue, are
activated at the low sous vide temperatures and contribute substantially to producing a more
tender product even if cooked rare.
The gentle cooking cycle, coupled with an equally gentle cooling phase and pressure created
by the vacuum, ensures that any juices, called exudates, are steadily reabsorbed into the
product, thus increasing its juiciness.
The vacuum that sous vide products are subjected to removes any resistance the products
have to counter the forces from the air around them. This, in effect, creates a pressure on the
exterior of the bag and product that not only forms the product into an attractive shape but
encourages it to absorb any aromatics that may be included along with it in the airtight area.
This same vacuum also lowers the boiling point of water that is present in the product’s cells,
which will cause it to boil and rupture the cells if the product is too warm when processed. For
this reason, products prepared for sous vide must be kept very cold prior to packaging.
The heating hardware that normally delivers precise temperatures to sous vide applications
can also be applied to non–sous vide items, with the intention of providing that same
precision and stable heat source for low-­temperature cooking to products that are not in
bags. An excellent example of this approach is the technique of cooking eggs in the shell with
a thermal circulator, wherein the coagulation temperatures of the eggs’ different proteins can
be targeted and attained to one’s liking.

Key Processes and Benefits of Use
The basic goal of any type of cooking that one may employ, traditional or sous vide, is to
maximize the organoleptic qualities (color, juiciness, tenderness, flavor, etc.) of the finished
product, while guaranteeing its safety and shelf life. Though traditional and sous vide cooking
methods have many things in common, and similar results are achievable with either
method, sous vide provides opportunities to the chef to incorporate the best of both the
organoleptic qualities and safety and shelf life in one approach. And even though it should not
be considered a preservation technique per se, properly cooked sous vide foods do have an
increased shelf life.
Some of the benefits are as follows:
• Juiciness: due to the retention of inherent moisture and reabsorption of cooking juices
(exudates) and the complete gelation of connective tissue in meats.
• Increased yield: due to reduced shrinkage from no evaporation or moisture loss, as well as
reduced fat loss for low-­fat melt-­point items like foie gras.
• Consistency: of color and texture throughout the product—­no “averaging”; this indicates
there is no range of doneness throughout the product: all is of one doneness. At this point,
it is up to the individual if they want to sear the product to add Maillard browning.
• Enhanced flavor and nutrition: achieved by having the liquid cooking medium not come
in direct contact with the food, thereby assuring that no flavor or nutrients are lost to the
cooking liquid; aromatics and marinades are more pronounced and effective; freshness is
retained and no oxidation occurs.
• Uniform shape: especially when bags with shrinkable properties are used, or gentle
pressure for delicate items.
596 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

• Texture modification: delicately textured foods can also be compressed or
altered for pleasing effects and flavor/texture shifts.
• Safety: in-­package pasteurization avoids recontamination, equating to a
microbiologically safe product with extended shelf life.

COOKING
POTATOES
The potato is one of the most
versatile vegetables. It is found in
nearly every menu category, as the
main component of appetizers,
soups, entrées, and side dishes; it is
also an important ingredient in some
preparations of soufflés, pancakes,
and breads.

The potato consists of skin and flesh, which can both be used in cooking. There are more
than 600 types of potatoes, all of which vary in color, shape, and size.
The components of a potato are around 80% water, 17% carbohydrates, 2% fiber—­most of it
comes from the skin—­and 1% protein. Potato cookery is, put simply, a matter of gelatinizing
the starch found within the flesh of the potato. This process is responsible for giving the
cooked potato a specific texture, as well as making it palatable for humans. It’s basically what
happens when water and heat are applied to potato starch, making the potato’s flesh soft
and tender.
The potato consists mainly of carbohydrates in the form of starch. But in the presence of
heat and water, the bonds of the starch molecules break down. The starch granules dissolve,
and the newly opened bond sites soak up and retain the water causing the potato to swell
slightly and soften.

POTATO VARIETIES
Potato varieties differ in starch and moisture content, skin and flesh color, and shape.
Sweet potatoes and yams, although not botanically related to the potato, share several
characteristics with it and can be treated in the same manner. Each cooking technique
produces a different texture, flavor, and appearance in potatoes. Knowing the natural
characteristics of each kind of potato and the ways in which a particular technique can either
enhance or detract from these characteristics is important to any chef.

Low Moisture/High Starch
Potatoes in this category include Idaho or russet (also known as baking or bakers), purple
potatoes, and some fingerling varieties. The higher the starch content, the more granular and
dry a potato is after it is cooked. The flesh is easy to flake or mash. These potatoes, desirable
for baking and puréeing, are also good for frying because the low moisture content makes
them less likely to splatter. Their natural tendency to absorb moisture also makes them a
good choice for scalloped or other en casserole potato dishes.

Moderate Moisture and Starch
Potatoes in this category include so-­called all-­purpose, boiling, chef’s, Maine, and US 1. It
also includes red-­skin, waxy yellow (e.g., Yellow Finn and Yukon Gold), and certain fingerling
varieties. Potatoes with moderate amounts of moisture and starch tend to hold their shape
even after they are cooked until tender. This makes them a good choice for boiling, steaming,
sautéing, oven roasting, and as a component of braises and stews. They are frequently used
in potato salads and soups. Many chefs like to use waxy yellow potatoes for baking, puréeing,
and casserole-­style dishes because of their outstanding flavor.

602 | POTATOES, GRAINS AND LEGUMES, AND PASTA AND DUMPLINGS

High Moisture/Low Starch
Potatoes in this category include “new” (any potato that is harvested when less than
1 1/2 in/4 cm in diameter) and some fingerling varieties. The skin of new potatoes is
tender and does not need to be removed prior to cooking or eating. Their naturally
sweet, fresh flavor is best showcased by simple techniques such as boiling,
steaming, or oven roasting.

FABRICATING POTATOES
Scrub the potatoes or peel them and remove any eyes and sprouts. Potatoes may be peeled
before boiling; tender-­skinned fingerlings or new potatoes are usually prepared unpeeled,
called en chemise in French. If the potatoes are to be cooked whole, try to make sure they are
similar in size. If necessary, cut the potatoes into regular, even shapes or cook different-­size
potatoes in separate vessels.
Green spots in a potato must be peeled away completely. The green color indicates
the presence of a toxin called solanine, which is harmful when eaten in large quantities.
This same toxin is present in the potato sprouts and eyes; they should be completely
removed as well.
Raw potatoes will oxidize and discolor after they are peeled, first turning light pink and
eventually, dark gray or black. To prevent this discoloration, submerge peeled or cut raw
potatoes in cold water until time to cook. When possible, use the soaking water to cook the
potatoes so any nutrients leached into it are retained. However, potatoes are best peeled just
prior to cooking.
Potatoes can be prepped differently, depending on the desired end result. The prep method
used can also have an effect on flavor and texture of the finished product. Factors to consider
include: size of the potato, peeled versus skin on, type of cut. Of course, the cooking method
used will have the greatest impact.

BOILING POTATOES
Boiled potatoes are among the simplest of preparations, with a subtle, earthy flavor. In the
absence of aromatic or supporting flavors, attention must be focused on good technique and
careful selection and handling of the potato itself.
• Each potato variety has a unique texture and taste once boiled. Some potatoes hold
their shape even when boiled until very tender, and have a soft, smooth consistency.
Others have a mealier consistency and a tendency to break apart when fully cooked. Both
boiled and steamed potatoes can be cooked to a range of doneness: partially cooked for
sautéed dishes, fully cooked for purées, and cooked and cooled for salads.
• Moderate-­or high-­moisture potatoes are a good choice for dishes where the potatoes
are presented whole, since they hold their shape when boiled. Low-­moisture potatoes are
preferable for purées.

604 | POTATOES, GRAINS AND LEGUMES, AND PASTA AND DUMPLINGS

• To ensure that potatoes cook evenly, start them in a cold liquid, usually water, though
some recipes specify stock or milk for a special flavor, texture, or appearance. Salt is
usually added to the cooking liquid. If using salt, add enough to enhance the potato’s flavor.
• Spices can be added to the boiling liquid as well; saffron or turmeric gives boiled
potatoes a golden color and special flavor. If parcooking, add slightly more salt than if fully
cooking the potatoes.
• Other ingredients can be added to develop additional flavor, like fresh herbs, ground
spices, and roasted garlic. Add at the appropriate time, usually after the potatoes have
been boiled.
• Potatoes should never be shocked in cold water after cooking. The potatoes will absorb
water as they cool and become unpalatable.
• The equipment needed for boiling potatoes is simple: a cooking pot large enough to hold
the water and potatoes, a slotted spoon or colander for draining the potatoes, and holding
containers. Sheet pans may be used to hold the potatoes in a single layer for quick cooling
or drying.

5 Simmer to the correct doneness.
6 Drain and dry the potatoes. Serve
immediately, purée, or hold for
another use.

1

Place the potatoes in a pot of an appropriate size and cover completely
with cold water. Add salt and/or other seasonings as necessary to the
cooking liquid. Starting the cooking process with cold liquid allows the
heat to penetrate slowly and evenly, giving the potatoes a uniform texture
without overcooking the exterior flesh. Bring to a boil and cook at a simmer
or low boil until the potatoes are done.

2

To test for doneness, taste a piece or pierce with the tines of a fork. If there
is no resistance, the potatoes are properly cooked. If the potatoes are to be
only partially cooked, there should be increasing resistance as the fork is
inserted deeper into the potato.

3

Drain the potatoes as soon as they are done and dry them to improve their
flavor and texture. Potatoes can be dried by returning them to the pot and
placing the pot, uncovered, over very low heat. Or spread them out in a
single layer on a sheet pan and place the pan in a warm oven. Potatoes are
sufficiently dried when steam no longer rises from them.
If the potatoes were cooked in the skin, remove the skin as soon as
they are cool enough to handle. Use a paring knife to remove eyes or black
spots. To hold potatoes for a short time (less than an hour), cover them
loosely with a damp, clean cloth and keep warm.

606 | POTATOES, GRAINS AND LEGUMES, AND PASTA AND DUMPLINGS

Quality Control for Boiled Potatoes
Properly boiled potatoes will:
• have a delicate aroma and flavor.
• hold their shape but still be extremely tender.
• be seasoned appropriate to the finished dish.

Puréeing Potatoes
Puréed potatoes are an important basic preparation. Potatoes to be puréed are first cooked
by boiling, steaming, or baking in the skin.
The purée can be blended with milk and butter to make whipped potatoes, with egg
yolks to make duchesse potatoes or potato croquettes, or with pâte à choux to fry as
pommes Lorette.
• Low-­to moderate-­moisture potatoes, such as russets and mealy yellow potatoes, make
the best purées. Have ready boiled or steamed potatoes that have been drained and dried
and that are still very hot. Hot baked potatoes may also be used.
• In addition to salt and pepper, which are standard seasonings for puréed potatoes, many
other ingredients may be added for special flavors. After they are puréed, the potatoes
may be flavored with oil, butter, cream, garlic, or other vegetable purées. All additional
ingredients should be heated either to the same temperature as the purée or at room
temperature.
Choices include milk or cream, soft (not melted) butter, chicken or meat broth, garlic,
shallots, green onions, horseradish, mustard, cheese, or purées of other vegetables,
such as parsnips or celeriac. Egg yolks or pâte à choux are needed for duchesse and
Lorette potatoes.
• A food mill or potato ricer gives the best texture for puréed potatoes. Use a handheld
potato masher for a coarser texture. Puréed potatoes may be blended with other
ingredients by hand using a wooden spoon or with an electric mixer for whipped potatoes.
Food processors and blenders should be avoided to prevent the potatoes from taking on
a gluey texture. A pastry bag with star and/or plain tips will be needed if the purée is to be
decoratively piped onto plates or shaped in various ways.

Quality Criteria of Puréed Potatoes
A properly puréed potato will:
• be smooth, with no evidence that fat has separated from the purée.
• have a light texture that holds its shape when dropped from a spoon.

BAKING AND ROASTING POTATOES
When potatoes are cooked in an oven without any added liquid or steam, they develop an
intense flavor and a dry, light texture. High-­starch potatoes like Idahos or russets become
fluffy and absorbent. The higher the moisture content of the potato, the creamier and moister
the baked potato will be.
The classic baked potato is served in its crisp skin and garnished with butter, salt, pepper,
and perhaps sour cream and chives. Roasted potatoes might be roasted whole (particularly
smaller varieties) or fabricated and served as a component of dish.
• Baked potatoes are often served as is, with their skins, but there are other uses and
presentations for them. The flesh can be scooped from the shell and puréed. This purée
can be served on its own or returned to the hollowed-­out skin in the preparation known as
stuffed or twice-­baked potatoes.

610 | POTATOES, GRAINS AND LEGUMES, AND PASTA AND DUMPLINGS

• For baking, low-­moisture potatoes are generally best, although yellow waxy potatoes
also yield good results. Blot the potatoes dry before placing them in a pan, to prevent an
excess of steam when they start to bake. Pierce the skin in a few places to allow the steam
that builds up during baking to escape.
• Never wrap the potato in foil before baking; the result is similar to steaming. The skin
will not become crisp, and there is a noticeable flavor difference. For the same reasons,
baked potatoes cannot be prepared successfully in a microwave oven. Some chefs believe
that baking potatoes on a bed of salt or rubbing the skin lightly with oil encourages the
development of a crisp skin and a delicate, fluffy interior.
• Equipment needs for baking potatoes are minimal. The only truly essential piece of
equipment is the oven. Potatoes can be placed directly on the oven racks; they can also be
arranged on sheet pans, making it easier to move them in and out of the oven, particularly
when dealing with large quantities.
• When oven roasting, the potatoes are cooked in oil, butter, or rendered juices from a
separately roasted item and cooked until browned on the outside and completely tender on
the inside.
• For oven-­roasting, low-­or high-­moisture potatoes may be used. Scrub potatoes well. For
a relatively thick-­skinned potato, a brush works well. For new potatoes, use a cloth.
• For oven-­roasted potatoes, scrub or peel them and cut into the desired shape. Toss in fat
(fat and drippings from roasted meats, oil, clarified butter, lard, goose fat, and so on) and
season as desired with salt and pepper, fresh or dried herbs, and/or spices.
• For oven-­roasted potatoes, sheet pans or shallow roasting pans that can hold the
potatoes in a single layer are needed. Also needed are utensils for stirring the potatoes as
they roast and holding and serving pieces.
• Additional ingredients or garnishes for baked potatoes are generally added after the
potatoes have been baked, whereas additional ingredients can be added to potatoes prior
to roasting to infuse flavor.

the potatoes may not cook as evenly.
Bake or roast the potatoes until they are tender. It takes about 1 hour
for a 6-­oz/170-­g potato to bake at 350°F/177°C. To test for doneness,
pierce the potato with a skewer or the tines of a fork. If there is no resistance when it enters the flesh, the potato is done.
Serve baked and oven-­roasted potatoes immediately. If this is not possible, they can be held, uncovered, for less than an hour in a warm place.
However, the steam trapped in the interior can cause the crisp skin to
become soggy over time. Stuffed potatoes may be prepared in advance and
held, covered, and refrigerated. Reheat and brown in a hot oven just prior to
service.
NOTE: For oven roasting, scrub, dry, and then cut the potatoes into a uniform shape if desired.
Peeling the potatoes is optional, as some chefs prefer leaving the skin on for a different texture
and increased nutritional value. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on a sheet pan or in a

Quality Criteria for Baked or Roasted Potatoes
A properly baked potato will:
• have very crisp skin and be tender enough to mash easily when fully cooked.
A properly roasted potato will:
• have a golden-­brown exterior that is well-­seasoned and not too oily.
• have a tender and creamy interior.

chapter 24 • COOKING POTATOES | 613

BAKING POTATOES EN CASSEROLE
For dishes prepared en casserole, peeled and sliced potatoes (either raw or parcooked to speed
baking time) are combined with flavored heavy cream, a sauce, or uncooked custard, and then
slowly baked until the potatoes are extremely tender but set well enough to hold a shape when
cut for service. Scalloped, au gratin, and dauphinoise potatoes are all good examples.
• Low-­moisture potatoes, because of their tendency to absorb liquid, produce casseroled
potatoes that are very tender. Yellow-­flesh potatoes are also often prepared en casserole;
these have a slightly more noticeable texture and a golden color.
• Scrub and peel the potatoes and remove the eyes. Thinly slice the potatoes or cut into
even dice. Thoroughly dry raw potatoes that have been held in water before combining
them with the other ingredients. Excess water can adversely affect the flavor and final
texture of the dish. Blot dry parcooked potatoes.
• Mandolines can be used to slice potatoes very thin for even layering and cooking.
• Heat the liquid component of the dish (cream, custard, or stock, for example) before
combining it with the potatoes. This allows the dish to reach cooking temperature more
quickly, thus shortening the cooking time; it also allows for the infusion of flavors from
ingredients like herbs and spices.

614 | POTATOES, GRAINS AND LEGUMES, AND PASTA AND DUMPLINGS

• Salt and pepper are basic for any en casserole dish. Other spices are often required. Many
of these dishes call for one or more grated cheeses, such as Gruyère and/or Parmesan.
Additional ingredients may be used to introduce color, flavor, and texture. Common options
include herbs, mushrooms, mustard, and breadcrumbs.
• En casserole dishes are prepared in hotel pans or similar baking pans and dishes.
Liberally grease the baking pan or dish with butter or oil to prevent sticking. Additional

Quality Criteria for Potatoes en Casserole
A properly prepared potatoes en casserole will:
• be moist and tender.
• hold its shape when cut into servings and plated.
• have a sauce that is thick and very smooth, not runny, grainy, or curdled.
• be brown and crisp on top, for extra flavor.

SAUTÉING POTATOES
Sautéed potatoes combine a browned and crisp exterior with a tender, moist interior. Home
fries, potatoes Anna, hash browns, rösti, and Lyonnaise potatoes are prepared by sautéing.
The cooking fat plays a significant role in the flavor of the finished dish, and choices range
from the taste of Anna-­style or rösti potatoes cooked in liberal amounts of butter, to the more
rustic flavor of hash browns or home fries sautéed in lard, oil, or duck fat.
• The key to successful sautéed potato dishes is in preparing the potatoes so that they
become fully cooked just as the exterior has finished developing a good color and texture.
• Moderate-­moisture potatoes give the best texture and appearance to sautéed dishes.
Scrub and peel the potatoes, and remove the eyes. Cut the potatoes into even slices,
dice, julienne, tourné, or balls. If the potatoes are peeled and cut in advance, hold them
submerged in cold water until it is time to cook them. Drain and blot them dry on paper
towels immediately before sautéing to avoid splattering.
• To shorten the cooking time, potatoes to be sautéed may first be partially or fully cooked
in advance by steaming or boiling. Drain and dry them before sautéing.
• Different kinds of cooking fat may be used, singly or in combination, for the best flavor
in the finished dish. They include vegetable oil, olive oil, clarified butter, or rendered duck,
goose, or bacon fat.
• Season the potatoes with salt and pepper during cooking. A wide range of herbs and
spices, vegetables, and meats can be combined with potatoes to produce a dish with a
special flavor or appearance. Among them are onions, shallots, and green onions; diced
green and red peppers; or diced bacon or ham.
• Finishing ingredients such as heated cream, melted butter, heated sour cream, or grated
cheese may be added to the potatoes during the actual cooking process or after they have
been cooked until tender.
• Choose a sauté pan large enough to hold the potatoes without crowding. Cast-­iron pans
are especially good for potatoes because they can create a crust of exceptional crispness.

DEEP FRYING POTATOES
French fries and steak fries as well as waffle-­cut, matchstick, and soufflé
potatoes are all deep-­fried potatoes. They seem simple to make but must be
done carefully if excellent quality is to be achieved.
• Most deep-­fried potatoes prepared from the raw state are first blanched in
oil heated to 300° to 325°F/149° to 163°C until tender and almost translucent.
They are then drained thoroughly and held until just before service. At that
time, they are finished in oil heated to 350° to 375°F/177° to 191°C.
• Blanching ensures that the finished potato has the proper color, texture, and
flavor and that it cooks thoroughly without becoming greasy or scorched. It is
especially important to blanch soufflé potatoes so that they puff adequately.
Very thinly cut potatoes (e.g., matchstick potatoes) can usually be cooked in
a single step, without first blanching.

them submerged in cold water. Rinse the potatoes in several changes of cold
water if indicated, and drain and dry them thoroughly to prevent splattering
when they are added to the oil.
• Potatoes that are to be deep fried for such preparations as straw or
matchstick potatoes, in particular, should be rinsed so they don’t clump
together as they cook. However, potatoes used for deep-­fried potato nests
and cakes need the cohesiveness provided by the surface starch and should
not be rinsed.
• Different cuts of potato will have different results. Thinner cuts will be crisp
throughout, while fatter or bigger cuts will yield a crisp exterior with a creamy
interior.
• Deep-­fried potatoes such as Lorette, croquette, and dauphine are made
from a purée.
• Choose a neutral oil with a high smoke point for frying the potatoes. Deep-­
fried potatoes are customarily seasoned with salt after frying and prior to
service. Condiments—­ketchup and malt vinegar are the most common—­may
be served with them.

622 | POTATOES, GRAINS AND LEGUMES, AND PASTA AND DUMPLINGS

These shoestring potatoes will be crispy all the way through

• Salt (and sometimes pepper) is the most typical seasoning for deep-­fried potatoes. In
addition to these, try applying different ground spices or spice mixtures after frying to suit
the profile of a particular dish. Add dry sprigs of fresh herbs with the potatoes. Frying fresh
herbs with the potatoes will infuse the oil and flavor the potatoes:
• Use either a frying kettle or a deep fryer. Electric or gas deep fryers are excellent for
doing a great deal of deep frying because they maintain even temperatures. They are
also put together in such a way that it is relatively easy to clean them and care for the oil
properly.
• Lacking a freestanding fryer, use a deep kettle or pot, such as a stockpot, instead. Use a
thermometer to monitor and control the temperature. Once the correct frying temperature
is reached, adjust the heat so that the temperature remains relatively constant. Other
equipment, such as baskets, tongs, spiders, and containers lined with paper towels, should
also be available.
• Deep-­fried potatoes cannot be held successfully for more than a few minutes.

Quality Criteria of Deep-­Fried Potatoes
Properly prepared deep-­fried potatoes will:
• be golden brown all over.
• be crisp on the exterior. Very thin potatoes, such as gaufrette (waffle-­cut) potatoes, should
be extremely crisp, almost to the point where they shatter when bitten. Thick-­cut potatoes
should have a crisp exterior and a tender, fluffy interior.

GRAINS AND
LEGUMES
Grains and legumes are key
components of dishes to satisfy
consumers seeking healthy, plantforward foods that align with special
diets and preferences. With huge
varieties in flavor, size, and texture,
these ingredients are welcome
additions to any dish.

Grains and legumes are dried foods that must be properly rehydrated by cooking in stock or
water before they can be eaten.
• Grains are the edible seeds from grassy plants, and the most popular grains come from
plants like oats, barley, rye, and millet.
• There are two types of grains: whole grains, such as oats, and refined grains, such as
white rice. Whole grains keep the germ, endosperm, and bran of the seed. Refined grains
have been milled to remove the germ and bran, leaving only the endosperm.
• For some market forms, the grains are partially or fully cooked, mainly to extend the
shelf life, before further processing.
• Legume is an umbrella term that refers to the pod of some edible plants, like green beans,
edamame, and sugar snap peas, but it is also often used to describe the edible seed from
that pod (known as a pulse), which is typically purchased dried. In this book, legume refers
to the seed, especially beans.
• Legumes are widely available and usually very affordable. They offer an incredible variety
of flavor, color, and texture to create dishes with. Their combination of deliciousness and
nutrition means they can become the center of a dish, not just a side. This combination also
means they are easy to pair with other vegetable proteins to create a complete protein.
• Legumes and most grains are usually combined with the liquid before bringing it to a
boil, but some grains (quinoa, for instance) are added to the liquid only after it has come
to a boil. Although grains and legumes are often referred to as boiled, they are actually
simmered or steamed.

SIMMERING WHOLE GRAINS
AND LEGUMES
When a grain completely absorbs the cooking liquid, it is often referred to as steamed. Grains
may also be cooked in a quantity of liquid greater than they can absorb; once the grain is fully
cooked, the excess liquid is drained away.
Sort whole grains and legumes carefully before cooking. Spread out the grains or legumes
in a single layer on a sheet pan and work from one end of the pan to the other systematically
to spot and remove stones and moldy beans. Put the beans or legumes in a large pot or
bowl and cover them with cold water. Any that float on the surface are too dry for culinary or
nutritional purposes and should be removed and discarded. Drain the beans or legumes in a
colander or sieve and then rinse them well with cold running water to remove any dust.

Soaking Grains and Legumes
Most legumes and some grains are soaked prior to cooking. Whole grains, such as whole or
Scotch barley and wheat and rye berries, benefit from soaking, which softens the outer layer
of bran. Pearl barley, which has had the bran removed mechanically, does not need to be
soaked. Imported basmati and jasmine rice should be soaked to remove excess starch from
the surface and prevent clumping. Domestic basmati and jasmine rice do not need to be
soaked. Steep fine-­or medium-­grind bulgur wheat in boiling liquid for several minutes, until
the grain softens enough to be chewed easily. Like bulgur, steep instant couscous in hot stock
or water. (While couscous is actually a form of semolina pasta, it is often thought of as a grain
because of its texture and appearance.)

Whether or not to soak legumes is a subject of debate among chefs. Some believe that
most legumes, with a few notable exceptions (lentils, split peas, and black-­eyed peas), are
easier to prepare and produce a better quality finished dish if they are soaked, because the
skins soften slightly, allowing for more rapid and even cooking. Others find that soaking has
no benefit beyond shortening the cooking time, and that cooking legumes without soaking
results in a creamier texture. If you choose to soak, there are two methods commonly used:
the long soak and the short soak. Except for time, there is no appreciable difference between
them. If grains or legumes are to be eaten at room temperature or chilled as for a salad, more
cooking time is required to achieve a softer texture.

The beans on the left are dry, and the beans on the right have been soaking for 12 hours. They have nearly
doubled in size.

The Long Soak Method
Place the sorted and rinsed legumes in a container and add enough cool water to cover them
by 2 in/5 cm. Let the legumes soak in the refrigerator for 4 hours to overnight, depending on
the type of legume.

The Short Soak Method
Place the sorted and rinsed legumes in a pot and add enough water to cover by 2 in/5 cm.
Bring the water to a simmer. Remove the pot from direct heat and cover. Let the legumes
steep for 1 hour.
Whether or not to use the soaking water as the cooking liquid is also a subject of debate.
In addition to softening skins, soaking the legumes causes many of the oligosaccharides
(indigestible complex sugars that can cause flatulence) in the legumes to be leached into
the water. At the same time, small amounts of nutrients, flavor, and color are also leached
into the water. When the soaking water is used as the cooking liquid, the nutrients, flavor, and
color are retained, but so are the oligosaccharides.
chapter 25 • GRAINS AND LEGUMES | 641

Water, stock, and broth are common choices for the cooking liquid. Each type of grain or
legume absorbs a different amount of liquid. Grains often are cooked in an amount of liquid
greater than they can actually absorb. This is especially desirable for grains that should
remain separate, fluffy, and very dry after cooking. The amount of liquid required for legumes
depends on the type and the age of the legume and its total cooking time. Legumes should
be completely covered by liquid at all times. It is important to maintain this level throughout
cooking. If the legumes are allowed to absorb all the liquid, they might break apart or scorch.
Salt needs to be added to the cooking liquid at the beginning of cooking time for grains or
near the end for legumes to properly enhance natural flavors. Legumes and grains have
relatively subtle flavors that frequently require a boost from spices and herbs either during
or after cooking. Additional ingredients may be added to develop more flavor, like aromatic
vegetables, fresh herbs, whole or ground spices, or smoked or cured meats. Adding them
directly to the grains or legumes will infuse flavor throughout the cooking process.
Grains are done when they are tender to the bite. They should be fluffy, with a sweet, nutty
flavor. Legumes are done when they are completely tender and creamy on the inside but still
retain their shape. They should be soft and easy to mash with a fork or spoon. Undercooking
legumes is a common mistake.
To keep legumes at the perfect tenderness, you have to cool them quickly. Use blast chillers
to stop the cooking process and get batches of legumes and pulses to the correct storing
temperature quickly.
The equipment needs for simmering grains and legumes are quite simple: a pot large enough
to allow for the expansion of the grain or legume, a colander or strainer if draining will be
required, and holding and serving pieces.

1

Cook the grain or legumes. Combine the grain or legumes with the cooking
liquid and bring to a full boil. Reduce the heat slightly to a simmer and cook
the grain or legumes until done as desired. Legumes and some grains need
to be stirred occasionally as they cook to prevent scorching. Check the
level of the cooking liquid and add more as necessary to keep the legumes
or grain completely covered.
To check for doneness, taste a grain or legume. Salt is typically added
to legumes after they have become tender. Adding salt or acidic ingredients, such as citrus juices or vinegar, earlier can toughen the skin if added
at the start of cooking time.
Drain the grain or legumes or let them cool in the cooking liquid if
they are to be used later. This keeps the skins tender. In some cases, the
cooking liquid is an important ingredient in the finished dish. Finish and
serve on heated plates or use in another preparation.
If the liquid is not entirely absorbed, drain the grains in a colander and
suspend it over a pot. Cover the pot and let the grain steam dry for a few
minutes over low heat. Use a fork to gently fluff the grain, but do not stir;
stirring may cause starch granules to burst, creating a gluey texture. Adjust
the seasoning as necessary and appropriate with salt, pepper, and other
ingredients. Hold the dish in a warm place, if necessary, until ready to serve.
chapter 25 • GRAINS AND LEGUMES | 643

SIMMERING AND BOILING
CEREALS AND MEALS
Culinary grains may undergo some type of processing (milling) before they reach the
kitchen to produce meals and cereals. When a whole grain is milled, it is broken down into
successively smaller particles. Depending on the grain, the result might be quite coarse
(cracked wheat or groats) or quite fine (cornmeal or farina). Some grains are treated before
milling. Bulgur wheat, for example, is steamed and dried before it is crushed.
• Cereals include various forms of oats, buckwheat groats, and rye flakes, as well as
cracked grains like bulgur. Meals include grits and polenta, farina, semolina, and cream of
rice. (Flours are even more finely ground.) Cereals and meals vary widely according to the
way in which they are processed. Meals and cereals may be ground coarsely or finely. The
bran and germ may be left intact or removed. Coarser cereals produce a dense, porridge-­
like texture; finer grinds produce a smooth, even silky, texture similar to a pudding.
• Water, stock, milk, or broth may be used as the cooking liquid, depending on the grain,
the dish, and the menu. Cereals and grain meals are generally cooked in just as much liquid
as they can absorb; each type of cereal or meal will absorb a different amount of liquid.
(Refer to package or recipe directions for details.)
• Additional ingredients may be added to develop more flavor, like aromatic vegetables,
bouquet garni, sachet d’épices. Adding them directly into the grains or legumes will infuse
flavor throughout the cooking process. Depending on the desired result, sweeteners
like sugar, honey, or maple syrup can be added to achieve a different flavor, and rich and
creamy ingredients like cheese or other dairy products may be added for a richer texture
and flavor.
• Salt is generally added to the cooking water, and sometimes spices or herbs are added
as well. Taste and adjust the seasoning at the end of the cooking time. Grains tend to need
considerable salt; otherwise, they taste flat.
• The pots for cooking the cereal or meal can be small or large, depending on the amount,
but in general they should have a heavy bottom to prevent scorching.

644 | POTATOES, GRAINS AND LEGUMES, AND PASTA AND DUMPLINGS

• Cold cooked meals such as polenta can be cut into a variety of shapes,
then sautéed, grilled, baked, or pan fried before being served. Ingredients
such as vegetables and cheese may be added to polenta when it is to be
chilled and baked or fried. Vegetables are cooked and then added to the grain
immediately after cooking while it is still hot. Vegetables should be cut into
small dice and sautéed and seasoned appropriately. Stir them into the hot,
just-­cooked polenta before it is chilled. Spread the polenta into an even layer,
cover, and refrigerate until it is thoroughly chilled. Cut as desired and pan fry
or bake to crisp the outside and heat through before serving.

• Rice is the grain most frequently used to prepare a pilaf, though other
grains, such as bulgur or barley, can also be used. If necessary, rinse and air-­
dry the grain by spreading it out in a thin layer on a sheet pan.
• A neutral-­flavored vegetable oil is most often used to sweat the aromatics
and sauté the grain, but a cooking fat that will contribute a flavor of its own,
such as butter or rendered duck fat, may also be used.
• Stock or broth is generally the preferred cooking liquid. Bring the liquid
to a boil in a separate pot before adding it to the grain to help shorten the
cooking time. To impart a particular flavor and/or color, substitute vegetable
or fruit juice or a vegetable coulis for up to half of the liquid. If the juice
is acidic (tomato juice, for instance), the cooking time may need to be
increased by as much as 15 to 20 minutes.

648 | POTATOES, GRAINS AND LEGUMES, AND PASTA AND DUMPLINGS

• A member of the onion family, such as finely diced or minced onions,
shallots, green onions, garlic, or leeks, is usually required for a pilaf. In
addition to onions, bay leaves and thyme are commonly used for flavor. Other
herbs and spices may also be added. Additional vegetables may be added
to sweat along with the onion. Other ingredients, including seafood, meat,
vegetables, and nuts, are often added.
• A heavy-­gauge pot of the appropriate size, fitted with a lid, is required to
allow steaming and to prevent scorching. Holding and serving pieces are also
needed.

• have individual grains that separate easily.
• show no visible liquid at the bottom of the pot.

652 | POTATOES, GRAINS AND LEGUMES, AND PASTA AND DUMPLINGS

Risotto
A classic risotto is a rich, creamy dish with nearly a porridge-­like consistency, yet each grain
of rice retains a distinct bite. In Italian risotto, the rice is parched as in the pilaf method, but
the liquid is added and absorbed gradually while the grain is stirred almost constantly. The
starch slowly releases during the cooking process, producing a creamy texture.
• Grated cheese is often included, and vegetables, meats, or fish may be added to create a
risotto that can be served as an appetizer or main course. Although risotto’s preparation is
relatively lengthy and requires constant attention, there are ways to streamline the process,
making it suitable for restaurant service.
• Risotto is traditionally made with special Italian varieties of medium-­grain round rice.
The best known of these is Arborio, but other varieties include Vialone Nano and Carnaroli.
• Other grains, including other long-­grain or brown rices, barley, wheat berries, or small
pasta shapes, may also be prepared with this method, but the quality of the finished dish is
not the same as a risotto made with an Italian medium-­grain rice. The cooking time will be
longer for brown rice and whole grains, and the amount of liquid required may be greater.
• The cooking liquid most often suggested for risotto is a high-­quality stock or broth.
Measure the appropriate quantity of stock or broth, season it if necessary, and bring to a
simmer before starting to cook. Simmering the stock first shortens the risotto’s cooking
time somewhat and provides an opportunity to add ingredients to infuse the broth with
flavor and color.
• Wine may replace a portion of the stock or broth in some recipes. Opinions differ
regarding whether wine should be added early in the cooking time or nearer the end. Some
chefs prefer to combine the stock and wine and bring them to a simmer together, to cook
away the harsh flavor of raw wine and improve the dish’s taste.
• There are three basic points at which flavoring and/or seasonings may be added to the
risotto.
• Before the rice is added, aromatic vegetables may be added to sweating onion to bolster
the finished flavor of a risotto. Some examples are carrots, celery, and garlic.
• Herbs and seasonings may be used by first adding them to the liquid to infuse. The
choice of liquid will also do a lot to determine the flavor of the finished dish and should
be selected carefully to complement all the other flavors.
• Near or at the end of cooking, garnish ingredients may be added. The timing for the
addition of these ingredients is important and will depend on the required cooking time
of the individual ingredient. Some ingredients may be added fully cooked, at the very end
of cooking.
• A wide, heavy-­gauge saucepan or sautoir is best for making risotto. Use a spoon,
preferably wooden or heat-­proof silicone, for stirring, and if the risotto is to be cooled and
finished later, use a sheet pan or similar wide shallow pan for rapid cooling.

Sprouting Grains
Sprouted grains are whole grains that have been soaked in water and allowed to
germinate or sprout. During the sprouting process, the grain’s outer shell softens,
and the germ and endosperm inside begin to grow into a new plant. However, the
sprouting process is usually halted before the plant becomes a full-­grown seedling.
To create sprouted grains, the grains are typically soaked in water for a specific
period, which triggers the germination process. After sprouting, they are usually
dried and milled into flour or used in various culinary applications.
Sprouting grains has a number of benefits for the dishes you use them in:
• It softens the grains.
• It starts germination, which adds healthy natural enzymes and vitamins.
• It changes the grain’s carbohydrates into vegetable sugars (more easily broken
down) from starches (way more difficult to break down).
• It lowers the amount of antinutrients in the grain. Antinutrients are natural in
plant-­based foods. They bind to nutrients in the food or in your gut, and make
them more difficult for your body to absorb.
If a recipe calls for sprouted grains, make sure your establishment follows an
acceptable, HACCP-­compliant process. The warm, humid conditions used to grow
sprouts make it easy for harmful bacteria to grow too, so they should be treated
with extra care to keep guests safe.

CHAPTER 26

PASTA AND
DUMPLINGS
The immense popularity of pastas
and noodles is not at all surprising.
Highly versatile, these foods are an
important element of most cuisines.
They are based on ingredients that
are inexpensive and easy to store:
flour or meal, and eggs. They adapt
well to a number of uses and can be
found on contemporary menus as
appetizers, entrées, salads, and even
desserts.

PASTA AND NOODLES
Noodles have evolved into one of the most popular foods worldwide. Found in
many cultures, they are the perfect vehicle for almost any accompaniment.
Tossed in simple or complex sauces, swimming in an aromatic broth with
morsels of meat and vegetables, or served cold as a salad, noodles possess a
unique versatility that can be enhanced by a number of accompaniments.
The protein-­rich durum wheat, common in Italy, provides pasta with its coveted
sturdiness and chew. The strength of the dough allows for a great variety of
shapes as well as industrial manufacturing.
East Asian wheat has a significantly lower protein content, resulting in tender
noodles with a slippery mouthfeel. In addition to wheat flour–based noodles,
Asian cuisines offer a great variety of noodles made from other starchy
ingredients. Examples include Chinese cellophane noodles made from mung
bean starch, Korean glass noodles based on sweet potato starch, and rice
noodles, which are common all over Southeast Asia.
Unlike pasta, these noodles are not made from a stiff dough, but from a slurry
or paste. This slurry is forced through a perforated disk into boiling water,
where it instantly cooks into thin, long strands. For other varieties, the starch
slurry is steamed into sheets and cut into fettuccine-­like ribbons. Depending on
the starch, these noodles can be crystal clear with a very smooth mouthfeel or
opaque and slightly textured.

Making Fresh Pasta
The formula for fresh pasta may be thought of as the base recipe to produce a
stiff dough that can be endlessly varied to produce myriad shapes, flavors, and
colors. The general category of pasta includes both dried and fresh noodles.
Pasta may be prepared fresh on the premises or purchased either fresh or
dried. There are advantages to both fresh and dried pastas. Fresh pasta gives
the chef freedom to create dishes with special flavors, colors, shapes, or fillings,
but it has a limited shelf life. Dried pasta can be stored almost indefinitely.
• Because flour provides the structure in pasta, it is important to choose
one that has the necessary qualities for making the best possible dough. All-­
purpose flours can be used successfully for most fresh pasta.
• Whole wheat flour, semolina, cornmeal, buckwheat flour, rye flour, ground
legumes (chickpeas, for instance), and other special flours and meals can
be used to replace a portion of the all-­purpose flour, giving the pasta unique
flavor, texture, and color. Experimentation is often the best way to determine
how to use special flours.
There are many alternatives to
traditional processed-­flour pasta.
Consider using them to cater to
guests looking to avoid gluten and to
introduce other guests to new flavors.

• Eggs are frequently included in fresh pasta to provide moisture, flavor,
and structure. Different formulas may specify the use of whole eggs, yolks,
or whites. Because it is especially important to have the proper amount of
moisture, many recipes call for water. Doughs that are too dry or too moist
are difficult to roll out.

670 | POTATOES, GRAINS AND LEGUMES, AND PASTA AND DUMPLINGS

• Neutral or flavored oil is often used in pasta doughs to keep the dough pliable and easy to
work with.
• Adding salt to the dough helps to develop flavor. Additional ingredients, such as herbs,
vegetable purées, or citrus zest, may be added to fresh pasta dough to change its color,
flavor, or texture. If these added flavoring or coloring ingredients contain a lot of moisture,
it is necessary to adjust the basic formula, by either using additional flour or less water.
Vegetable purées used for flavor or color are often dried slightly by cooking in an open
vessel in order to concentrate their flavors.
• Add flavor to pasta dough during mixing with the addition of herbs, spices, flavored or
infused liquids, and vegetable purées.
• For spinach pasta, a purée of fresh spinach can be added to the eggs and then mixed with
the flour. For carrots, beetroot or butternut squash, you can cook and purée the vegetables,
or juice them to add to the eggs. For red pepper, use puréed roasted red peppers. For squid
ink pasta, squid ink is added to the eggs, and then mixed with the flour.
• Cover and refrigerate fresh pasta for up to 2 days. If the pasta is cut in long strands,
sprinkle it with cornmeal, semolina, or rice flour to keep the strands from sticking together.
Hold the pasta on trays lined with plastic wrap, and cover it with plastic wrap as well. Filled
pastas should be held on parchment-­lined sheet trays, arranged so that they are not
touching each other.
• If the pasta is to be stored for more than 2 days, roll long strands of nonfilled pastas into
loose nests and arrange them on parchment-­lined sheet trays. Set the trays in a warm, dry
place for several days, until the pasta has hardened and dried. Once dried, pasta may be
held, well wrapped, in a cool, dry place the same way as commercial dried pastas. Fresh
pasta, especially filled pastas such as tortellini and ravioli, may also be frozen successfully.
• Equipment needs for fresh pasta are very basic, though a few special pieces of equipment
can make the job even simpler. At the very least, you will need your hands, a rolling pin, and
a knife. Or use an electric mixer with a dough hook or a food processor to mix the dough,
and a pasta-­rolling machine to roll it out. Cutting attachments that result in uniform cuts of
pasta are available for rolling machines.

it rest before rolling it out.

3

Gather and smooth the dough into a ball, cover, and let it relax at room
temperature for at least 1 hour. If it is not sufficiently relaxed, it will be
difficult to roll into thin sheets. This resting phase is particularly important
if the dough is to be rolled by hand.

4

Guide the pasta through the machine at the widest setting. Reduce the
setting as you roll the pasta to create thin sheets.
Cut off a piece of dough (the amount will vary, depending on the width
of the machine) and flatten it; cover the rest. Set the rollers to the widest
opening and begin to guide the dough through the machine to form a long,
wide strip, lightly flouring it as necessary to prevent sticking. Roll the pasta
dough into thin sheets and cut into the desired shapes. Hold the dough
under plastic wrap if it is not to be cooked immediately.
Pasta and egg noodle doughs can be rolled and cut by hand or using a pasta machine. To roll by hand, flatten a piece of dough about the size of an orange
on a flour-­dusted work surface. Using a rolling pin, work from the center of the
dough to the edges with a back-­and-­forth motion to roll and stretch the dough,
turning it occasionally and dusting it with flour, until it reaches the desired
thickness. Once rolled into sheets, the pasta can be cut with a knife into thin
strips for flat or ribbon-­style pastas such as fettuccine or linguine, or stamped
with cutters into squares or circles to make filled pastas such as ravioli.

672 | POTATOES, GRAINS AND LEGUMES, AND PASTA AND DUMPLINGS

5

Join the two ends of the sheet to roll it in one continuous loop. In this
method of rolling pasta, fold the strip into thirds, like a letter, and run it
through the rollers again. Repeat this step one or two times, folding the
dough into thirds each time. If necessary, dust the dough with flour to keep
it from sticking to the rollers and tearing.
Continue to roll the pasta through the machine, setting the rollers at a
narrower setting each time, until the sheet of pasta is the desired thickness. The dough should feel smooth and not at all tacky. To prevent drying,
keep it covered when not working with it.

Note: Different machines have different methods of operation. These directions are for
making pasta sheets with the common two-­roller hand-­operated machine. (Tube pastas,
such as macaroni or ziti, are made by forcing the dough through a special die in an extrusion
pasta maker.)

6

Cut the sheets of pasta using a machine attachment, a knife, or cutters.
The pasta may be cooked fresh as is, or placed on racks or loosely formed
into nests and allowed to dry for storage.

Quality Criteria of Prepared Pasta Dough
Properly prepared pasta dough will:
• be smooth, fairly elastic, and just slightly moist to the touch.
• hold its shape when cooked.

Cooking Pasta and Noodles
Cook pasta and noodles, both fresh and dried, in a large amount of salted water to ensure the
best flavor and an even and appealing texture. Some pastas and noodles cook very rapidly.
Others take several minutes to cook properly. If you are working with an unfamiliar shape or
style of commercially made pasta, be sure to consult the instructions on the package.
• Serve all pasta and noodles as soon as possible after cooking to ensure the best texture
and flavor. This is especially true of fresh pasta. However, there are appropriate techniques
to hold cooked dried pastas to streamline cooking during service (see the section “Holding
Pasta for Service”).
• Al dente pasta is the most desired doneness for the majority of pastas or noodles. The
term al dente is Italian for “to the tooth” and refers to pasta that is very slightly crisp,
instead of mushy or overcooked. Cook the pasta or noodles until they can be bitten into
easily, but still offer a slight resistance and sense of texture.
• Fresh pasta cooks rapidly, which makes it easy to overcook; it should be completely
cooked but not raw or doughy.
• Dry and fresh pasta and noodles should be chosen
according to the menu or recipe requirements. Water
is the most common cooking liquid, although some
preparations may call for stock. Salt is added to the
water as it comes to a boil.
• Choose a pot that is taller than it is wide for most pasta
and noodles. Filled pasta may be prepared in pots that
are wider than they are tall to make it easier to remove
the pasta without breaking it.
• For large amounts of pasta, you may use special pasta
cookers, which resemble deep fryers. Place the pasta
in a wire or perforated basket with a handle and lower it
into boiling or simmering water until cooked, then lift the
basket out of the water, allowing the pasta to drain. Have
available colanders, strainers, and skimmers to drain the
pasta.

Many of the starch-­based Asian
varieties like cellophane, rice, or glass
noodles only need to be rehydrated by
soaking them in boiling water.

4 Drain the pasta immediately and serve it

2

Drain the flat or extruded pasta or noodles in a colander, shaking gently
to help the cooking water drain away. Tube shapes are prone to holding
water; gently stirring them with gloved hands helps to drain away as much
water as possible. Filled pastas should be lifted from the cooking water
gently with a spider or slotted spoon to avoid bursting them. They may be
transferred to a colander to drain or blotted briefly on towels to remove
excess water.
Fresh pasta is best served immediately. It is ready to sauce or otherwise finish and serve now. Dried pasta may be properly cooled and stored
for later service.

Note: Reserve some of the drained pasta water to adjust the sauce’s consistency, if necessary.

Quality Criteria of Cooked Pasta
Properly cooked pasta will:
• be tender, but with a discernible texture; al dente, not mushy.
• have individual, separate noodles that have not clumped during cooking.

Pairing Pasta with Sauces
Sauces are customarily selected to suit a particular type of pasta. Texture is an important
part in how sauce sticks to pasta. Penne pasta has ridges that sauce clings to. Farfalle’s wing
shapes scoop up sauce as you eat them.
• Long, flat pastas such as fettuccine or linguine are generally served with smooth, light
sauces such as cream sauces, vegetable coulis, or butter and cheese combinations that
will coat the strands evenly.
• Tube pastas such as elbow macaroni or ziti and twisted pastas such as fusilli are normally
paired with more heavily structured sauces, such as a meat sauce or one with a garnish of
fresh vegetables, because these shapes are able to trap the sauce.
• Fresh pasta is delicate and has a different flavor to dried pasta. To not lose that fresh taste,
they pair well with light vegetable purée, nut cream, regular cream, or butter-­based sauces.
These are similar to the sauces that pair with long flat pasta, but generally, flavors should
be more subtle to allow the fresh pasta to shine.
• Grain-­based pasta like buckwheat, brown rice, or quinoa pair well with savory sauces. The
earthiness of their flavor complements mushrooms, browned butter, toasted nuts, or a
bright tomato sauce.
• Ravioli, cannelloni, and tortellini are examples of filled pasta. Their flavor and substance
come from their filling. Typically served with cream-­or cheese-­based fillings, you can
create a light, sweet, and smooth filling of roasted sweet potato and cashew cream. Any
sauce added is for an extra flavor and to add moisture. Light sauces or pestos work best for
filled pasta.

GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR SERVING
FRESH AND DRIED PASTA
Pasta dishes are suited to many different service styles. The speed and ease of preparing
pasta makes it a good choice for à la carte restaurants; in fact, some restaurant kitchens
include a separate pasta station on the hot-­food line. When properly prepared, handled,
and held, pasta can also be used for banquet and buffet service. Both the pasta and the
accompanying sauces can be prepared in advance.
For à la carte service, cook or reheat the pasta as close to service time as possible. Since
pasta loses heat rapidly, be sure to heat the bowls or plates on which it is to be served and
serve it immediately.
For buffet service, choose sturdy pastas that will hold up well. Fully preheat the steam table or
heat lamps before placing the pasta on the buffet line. Cook, reheat, and/or finish the pasta
as close to serving time as possible. Choose a hotel pan deep enough to contain the pasta

and moisture rapidly. Even in a steam table, heat is lost rapidly. There is a limit to how long
pasta dishes can be held successfully for buffet service, so try to put out smaller amounts
and replenish it frequently. Holding pasta dishes over heat for too long can cause the sauce to
dry out and the pasta to begin to lose its texture.

Holding Pasta for Service
Fresh pasta does not hold as well as dried pasta, and since it cooks rapidly, it is usually
feasible to cook it fresh to order during service. Because it takes longer to cook, dried pasta
is sometimes cooked ahead of time and held for service. Rapidly cool and store the pasta, if
appropriate or necessary, and reheat servings or batches as needed at service.
If pasta is prepared in advance and held, it should be slightly undercooked so that it will not
overcook during reheating. To cool the pasta, rinse it thoroughly with cold water and drain it
well. Alternatively, spread the pasta out in a thin layer on a sheet pan and refrigerate. When
thoroughly cooled in this fashion, a small amount of oil can be used to toss with the pasta
while still warm to prevent it from sticking together.
To reheat the pasta, bring some salted water to a boil. There should be enough water to
generously cover the pasta, though not so much as is required for cooking. Lower the pasta
into the water in a basket or by dropping it in, and let it simmer just long enough to heat
through, depending upon the thickness of the pasta. Remove the pasta from the water and
drain it well before finishing it for service.

MORE TO KNOW
Dumplings
A dumpling is a broad term used to describe various types of dough-­based food items that
are sometimes filled then cooked. Dumplings are found in many cultures around the world
and come in numerous shapes, sizes, and flavors.
Some dumplings are based on doughs and batters, and others on ingredients ranging from
bread to puréed potatoes. The popular Chinese dim sum, including steamed yeast doughs
and fried egg rolls, is yet another category. Dumplings may be cooked in different ways,
according to type. They may be simmered in liquid, steamed, poached, baked, pan fried, or
deep fried. A variety of ingredients can be used. See the recipes included in this chapter for
specific instructions.
• Changing the ratio of flour to liquid or introducing other ingredients into a basic pasta
formula produces doughs and batters that are handled and cooked differently from the
base recipe. For example, the amount of liquid can be increased to create a soft batter for
spätzle. This batter is cut off a spätzle board or dropped through a colander or spätzle
maker into simmering liquid, rather than rolled or extruded as for a thicker pasta dough.
• Adding a leavener to the basic pasta formula produces a soft batter that can be used for
larger dumplings with a bread-­like texture that are simmered in a stew or other liquid.

Making Stuffed Pasta
When making stuffed pasta, you may be instructed to add a small amount of oil to the dough
to help it stick together better when sealed around a filling. Roll the pasta out to the thinnest
setting on a pasta machine.
chapter 26 • PASTA AND DUMPLINGS | 679

While rolling and filling one portion of the dough, keep the rest covered with
plastic wrap to make sure it stays moist and pliable. Cut and fill the sheets as
soon as possible after they are rolled. As they dry, they become more difficult to
seal properly.

Forming Ravioli
Lightly flour a clean dry work surface and lay down a thinly rolled pasta sheet.
Use a round cookie cutter to cut out as many rounds as possible, or a sharp
knife to cut squares.
Using a teaspoon or pastry bag, place or pipe a small amount of the filling in the
center of each circle or square. The amount of filling will vary depending on the

TIPS OF THE TRADE
• Using a combi oven is an efficient way
to batch cook pasta in preparation for
service. Set the combi oven to steam
mode (212°F/100°C). Then pour about
half an inch of well-­salted water over the

size of the pasta round or square. Lightly moisten the edges of the pasta round
or square with a pastry brush dipped in cool water or egg wash. Top each with
another pasta round or square and press firmly with your fingertips to seal. Use
the tines of a fork to crimp the edges together. Refrigerate the finished ravioli

hot for longer.

Troubleshooting
Q: Just-­rolled and cut pasta is very sticky and difficult to work with.
A: The pasta may have too much moisture in the dough, but it may also just
need to be dusted with extra flour after rolling. Start there, and if it is still sticky,
adjust your recipe by omitting an egg, or even just an egg white, to start, or by
increasing the flour slightly.
Q: My filled pasta is bursting in the boiling water as it cooks.
A: The filled pasta may be overfilled, so the filling is bursting out of the seams.
But it is also possible the seams were not tightly sealed enough. Brush the
dough with water or beaten egg at any connection points, and use your fingers
or a fork to firmly seal all edges.

EGGS AND THE
COLD KITCHEN

CHAPTER 27

COOKING EGGS
From encouraging the Maillard
reaction to binding liquids and
making pastries rise, eggs play a
central role in the kitchen. Their
chemical makeup makes them useful
in a range of recipes, and they’re
essential ingredients in baking. On
their own, they make delicate but
filling dishes that are enjoyed around
the world. Whether they’re used in
sauces, soups, meringues, desserts,
appetizers, or as is, eggs will be a
huge part of your cooking journey
because they are one of the most
versatile ingredients in the kitchen.

Eggs can be cooked in the shell, poached, fried, scrambled, or prepared as
omelets or soufflés. Using fresh eggs for cooking is important to ensure the
best flavor and quality of the finished dish.
• The top grade of eggs, AA, indicates that the eggs are fresh. They will have a
white that does not spread excessively once the egg is cracked and the yolk
should ride high on the white’s surface.
• Check each egg carefully and discard any with cracked shells. Eggs should
always be properly refrigerated until you are ready to cook them.
• The yolk and egg white coagulate at different temperatures because of the
kind of protein each part has. Egg whites have proteins that coagulate at a
lower temperature than the lipoproteins present in egg yolks.

Today’s consumer is well aware of the potential for food-­borne illness through
eggs. Therefore, we will look at basic rules for safe handling of eggs and foods
containing eggs.
• All eggs in the shell should be free from cracks, leaks, and obvious holes.
• Raw egg yolks are a potentially hazardous food, due to the possible presence
of Salmonella enteritidis bacteria. Salmonella bacteria are killed when the eggs
are held at a temperature of at least 140°F/60°C for a minimum of
3 1/2 minutes. The bacteria are also killed instantly at 160°F/71°C. Fried eggs or
poached eggs with runny yolks should be prepared only at customer request.
• Any food containing eggs must be kept at safe temperatures throughout
handling, cooking, and storage. Cooling and reheating must be done quickly.

COOKING EGGS IN THE SHELL
Eggs cooked in their shell refers to the process of boiling an egg while it is still
inside its protective shell. This is one of the most common and straightforward
methods of preparing eggs, and it’s often used to make hard-­boiled eggs or
soft-­boiled eggs, depending on the cooking time.
• Select a pot deep enough for the eggs to be submerged in water. Have on
hand a slotted spoon, skimmer, or spider to remove eggs from the water
once they are cooked.
• Place the eggs in a pot with enough water to completely submerge them (the
water level should be approximately 2 in/5 cm above the eggs) and add the salt.
• It is common to have the water already at a simmer when preparing
coddled and soft-­cooked eggs. Hard-­cooked eggs may be started in
simmering or cold water. In either case, lower the eggs gently into the pot so
700 | EGGS AND THE COLD KITCHEN

they won’t crack, and return (or bring) the water to a simmer. Do not allow
the water to boil rapidly. Water that is at or close to a simmer will allow the
eggs to cook evenly, without toughening the whites.
• Start timing the cooking only once the water reaches a simmer and cook
to the desired doneness. For example, a 3-­minute egg cooks for 3 minutes
from the time the water returns to a simmer after the egg has been added to
the water. If the timing is started when the water is cold, the egg will not be
properly cooked. Simmer hard-­cooked eggs for 10 to 12 minutes.
• Hard-­cooked eggs are easiest to peel while they are still warm. Place them
under cold running water until they are cool enough to handle. Gently press
down and roll the egg over a countertop to crack the shell before peeling.
Peel the shell and membrane away with your fingers.
• The yolks of properly cooked soft-­boiled eggs are warm but still runny,
while those of medium-­cooked eggs are partially coagulated. Properly hard-­
cooked eggs are completely and evenly coagulated, with firm but tender (not
tough) whites and no unsightly green ring surrounding the yolk.

from forming is to watch the cooking time closely and not allow the eggs

forming.

without its shell. The process involves carefully cracking the egg and allowing it
to cook directly in the hot water, resulting in a delicate and tender texture with
a runny yolk. Poached eggs usually have liquid yolks, which means they have
their own built-­in sauce. The liquid yolk and tender white provide a touch of
richness to simple vegetable hashes, or can even go well with cold green salads.
• The fresher the egg, the more centered the yolk, the
less likely the white is to spread and become ragged.
• The shape of the finished poached egg can be
affected by its handling prior to and during the cooking
process. For a desirable shape, handle the eggs
carefully when removing them from the shell, when
dropping them into the water, and when removing the
finished poached eggs.
• Choose a nonreactive pot that is deep enough for the
eggs to remain completely submerged. The size of the
pan depends on the size of the batch. Have cups to hold
the raw eggs, as well as a slotted spoon, skimmer, or
spider for retrieving the eggs from the water, and paper
towels to blot the eggs dry, a paring knife for trimming
the eggs, and holding and serving pieces.
• Eggs are most often poached in water, though other
liquids such as wine, stock, or cream can also be used.
• Add vinegar and salt to the water to encourage the
egg protein to set faster. Otherwise, the egg whites
can spread too much before they coagulate. Generally,
8 fl oz/240 mL vinegar and 1 tbsp/10 g salt for each
1 gal/3.84 L of water are sufficient.

For some dishes, eggs are poached in a sauce and then served
alongside the sauce

702 | EGGS AND THE COLD KITCHEN

• An instant-­read thermometer helps to accurately
monitor the temperature of the water.
• Poached eggs can be prepared in advance and
held safely throughout a typical service period to
make the workload easier during service. Slightly
underpoach the eggs, shock them in ice water to
arrest the cooking process, trim them, and hold
them in cold water. At the time of service, reheat
the eggs in simmering water.

Like chicken eggs, small quail eggs can also be poached and served similarly
or bite-sized for brunch or buffet presentations.

FRYING EGGS
A fried egg is an egg that has been cooked in a skillet or frying pan
with hot oil or butter until the whites are set, and the yolk is cooked
to the desired level of doneness. Fried eggs call for perfectly fresh
eggs, the correct heat level, an appropriate amount of cooking fat,
and a deft hand.
• American-­style fried eggs may be served sunny side-­up (not
turned) or over (turned once). Fried eggs may be basted with
fat as they fry. Dishes like huevos rancheros, for example,
feature fried eggs as part of a hearty dish of eggs, tortillas,
and beans.
• Using very fresh eggs is the only way to ensure a rich flavor
and good appearance in the finished dish. When very fresh
eggs are broken onto a plate, the yolk sits high on the white
near the white’s center. The white is compact and thick and it
holds the yolk in place. When the egg is fried, the white holds
together in a neat shape and the yolk is more likely to stay
intact. As eggs age, the white and yolk weaken and thin.
• To prepare eggs for frying, break them into clean cups.
Any eggs with broken yolks can be reserved for another use.
Refrigerate the shelled eggs. (This may be done up to 1 hour

• Place a frying pan over medium heat. Add the fat to the pan and continue
to heat until the fat is hot. The ideal temperature range for frying an egg is
255° to 280°F/124° to 138°C—­the same range at which butter sizzles without
turning brown.

AT-­A-­GLANCE
1 Heat fat to 255° to 280°F/124° to 138°C.
2 Slide cracked eggs into pan.
3 Cook to desired doneness.

• If using a griddle, adjust its temperature and brush the surface with oil or
another cooking fat. If the heat is too low, the egg will stick; if it is too high,
the edges of the white may blister and brown before the rest of the egg is
properly cooked.
• Break the eggs into cups. Fried eggs should have intact yolks, unless the
customer requests that they be broken. Slide or pour the egg out of the cup
and into the pan.
• Cook the eggs until done as desired. Eggs are done once the whites have
coagulated; the yolks may be soft and runny or set. For eggs cooked over
easy or over hard, flip the eggs or turn them with a spatula. You may baste
the eggs with hot fat to set the top instead of turning them. Or sprinkle a few
drops of water on the egg, cover the pan, and let the water steam the eggs.

SCRAMBLING EGGS
Scrambled eggs are eggs that have been whisked together and then cooked in
a skillet until they form curds.
• Scrambled eggs can be made in two ways: the eggs can be stirred
constantly over low heat for a soft, delicate curd and a creamy texture or
stirred less frequently as they cook for a larger curd and a firmer texture.
Whether prepared to order or to serve on a buffet line, scrambled eggs must
be served hot, fresh, and moist.
• Adding a small amount of water or stock (about 2 tsp/10 mL per egg) to
the beaten eggs will make them puffier as the water turns to steam.
• Milk or cream may be used to enrich the eggs. Scrambled eggs can be
seasoned with salt and pepper, and/or flavored or garnished with fresh
herbs, cheese, sautéed vegetables, smoked fish, or truffles.
• Blend the eggs just until the yolks and whites are combined. Add liquid,
if using, and seasonings. Use a fork or a whisk to blend everything into a
smooth, homogeneous mixture.
• Eggs can be scrambled in a sauté pan or on a griddle. Nonstick surfaces
make it easy to prepare scrambled eggs with a minimum amount of added
fat. Black steel pans are appropriate, as long as they are properly maintained
and seasoned. A heatproof rubber spatula, wooden spoon, or spatula is
needed for stirring the eggs as they cook.
• The lower the heat and the more constant the agitation, the creamier the
finished scrambled eggs will be. In fact, they may be prepared by stirring
them constantly over a water bath to prevent browning altogether.
• Add garnishes, cheeses, or flavoring ingredients once the eggs are
almost completely set; fold these ingredients in over low heat, just until
incorporated. Remove the eggs from the heat when slightly underdone; they
will continue to cook slightly from the heat they retain.

MAKING OMELETS
An omelet is a dish made from beaten eggs cooked in a skillet with various fillings. The eggs
are typically whisked until the yolks and whites are well combined and then poured into a hot
skillet, where they are cooked until set.
• The rolled (French-­style) omelet starts out like scrambled eggs, but when the eggs start
to set, they are rolled over. A folded (American-­style) omelet is prepared in much the same
manner, though it is often cooked on a griddle rather than in a pan, and instead of being
rolled, the American omelet is folded in half.
• There are two other styles of omelets, both based upon a beaten mixture of eggs:
Flat omelets, known variously as farmer-­style omelets, frittatas (Italian), or tortillas
(Spanish), are a baked version. The finished dish is denser and easier to slice into servings,
and can be served at room temperature.
Souffléed or puffy omelets are made from eggs first separated into yolks and whites. The
beaten whites are folded into the beaten yolks and the dish is prepared by baking the
omelet in a hot oven.
• Eggs for omelets should be beaten only enough to blend the yolk and white, not enough
to incorporate air or make them frothy.
• The addition of a liquid can affect both the flavor and texture of the finished omelet.
Liquids to consider include water, stock, milk, and heavy cream.
• Season omelets with salt, pepper, and herbs. Clarified butter is the most common
cooking fat, although vegetable oils also work well.
• Omelets may be filled or garnished with cheese, sautéed vegetables or potatoes, meats,
and smoked fish, among other things. These fillings and garnishes are incorporated at the
appropriate point to be certain they are fully cooked and hot when the eggs have finished
cooking. Grated or crumbled cheeses will melt sufficiently from the heat of the eggs, and
are often added just before an omelet is rolled or folded.
• Start larger frittatas, as well as souffléed omelets, in a pan heated in the oven with the
cooking fat before adding the eggs. Add garnishes for flat and souffléed omelets at the
start of cooking time. For rolled or folded omelets, add fillings such as cheese when the
curds are barely set.
• Rolled and souffléed omelets are made individually in omelet pans, which are basically
small sauté pans. Omelet pans should either be well seasoned or have a nonstick surface.
Treat pans carefully and avoid scratching a non-­stick surface with metal. A wooden spoon
or heat-­resistant rubber spatula is useful to stir the eggs as they cook.
• Consider the size of the pan in relation to the size of the omelet (number of eggs) you are
making. A pan that is too large or too small will have an ill effect on the end result of the
omelet.

SAVORY SOUFFLÉS
A savory soufflé is a classic French dish that consists of a light and airy
baked mixture of a flavored base combined with beaten egg whites. The word
“soufflé” comes from the French word “souffler,” which means “to blow” or “to
puff,” reflecting the dish’s characteristic rise and airy texture. The preparation,
assembly, and baking of a soufflé are not difficult tasks on their own. The tricky
part is timing.
• The basic components of any soufflé, sweet or savory, are the base and
beaten egg whites. A heavy béchamel, often with the incorporation of egg
yolks, is the base for many savory soufflés. Other mixtures or preparations,
such as vegetable purées, can be used as the base or to flavor a base. It
is important that the base mixture provide enough structure to keep the
soufflé from collapsing as soon as it is removed from the oven.
• The base contains the flavoring for a soufflé. When adding flavoring or
seasoning to the base, it is important that it be somewhat strong. The
addition of beaten egg whites will dilute the flavor, so the base should start
off very flavorful to account for this.
• Some ingredients that may be used as flavoring or seasoning for a soufflé
base include finely chopped seafood or meat, grated cheeses, grated
vegetables, or vegetable purée.
• Egg whites give both volume and structure to the soufflé. They should be
carefully separated from the yolks and beaten to soft peaks just before they
are folded into the base. The yolks may be incorporated into the soufflé base,

Any traces of fat, like from yolks or other
ingredients, can keep the egg whites

and whisks to beat the egg whites for the
best volume in the finished soufflé.

• A variety of sauces may be served with soufflés. Mornay Sauce (page 366),
vegetable coulis, or various tomato sauces are appropriate for savory
soufflés.
• Soufflés are usually baked in ceramic or glass soufflé dishes or ramekins.
For the best rise, the sides of the dish should be straight. To prepare the
molds, butter them lightly but thoroughly and dust the sides and bottom
with grated Parmesan, flour, or bread crumbs, if desired.
• The oven should be set to the appropriate temperature, generally 400° to
425°F/204° to 218°C for an individual portion. The temperature should be
slightly lower for larger soufflés.

Place the eggs in a pot. Fill the pot with enough cold water to cover the eggs by 2 in/5 cm.

2

Bring the water to a boil and immediately lower the temperature to a simmer. Begin timing the cooking at this point.

3

Cook small eggs for 10 minutes, medium eggs for 11 minutes, large eggs for 12 to 13 minutes, and extra-­large eggs for
14 minutes.

4

Cool the eggs quickly in cold water and peel as soon as possible. Serve the eggs now or refrigerate until needed.

NOTES: Cracking the eggs just after cooking will allow the trapped gases inside to escape, thus reducing the amount of green discoloration around
the yolk. Additionally, the eggs will peel more easily if peeled as soon as they are cool enough to handle. If allowed to cool completely, the membrane
under the skin tends to stick to the hard-­cooked egg white, making the egg difficult to peel.

An alternative method for hard-­cooking eggs is to remove the pot holding the eggs from the heat when the water
reaches a boil. Cover the pot and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. This method is best suited for
cooking large batches of eggs (2 dozen or more).
Coddled Eggs: Lower cold eggs into already simmering water and simmer for 30 seconds.
Soft-­Cooked Eggs: Lower cold eggs into already simmering water and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.

For each portion, beat three eggs well and season with salt and pepper. Add 1 tablespoon/15 mL liquid, if using.

2

Heat a nonstick omelet pan over high heat and add the butter, tilting the pan to coat the entire surface.

3

Pour the egg mixture into the pan and scramble it with the back of a fork, heatproof rubber spatula, or wooden
spoon. Move the pan and utensil at the same time until the egg mixture has coagulated slightly. Smooth the eggs into
an even layer.

4

Let the eggs finish cooking without stirring.

5

Tilt the pan and slide a fork or spoon around the lip of the pan under the omelet, to be sure it is not sticking. Slide the
omelet to the front of the pan and use a fork or a wooden spoon to fold it inside to the center.

6

Turn the pan upside down, rolling the omelet onto the plate. The finished omelet should be oval.

NOTES: Options for filling an omelet: A precooked filling may be added to the eggs after they have been smoothed into an even layer and before the
omelet is rolled. Alternatively, the rolled omelet can be slit open at the top, and a precooked, heated filling or sauce can be spooned into the pocket.
To give the omelet additional sheen, brush the surface lightly with butter.

Plain Rolled Egg White Omelet: Substitute 60 fl oz/1.80 L egg whites for the whole eggs and omit the optional liquid.
For each serving, beat 6 fl oz/180 mL egg whites well and season with salt and pepper. Heat an omelet pan over
medium heat and add the butter. (Alternatively, use a light coating of cooking spray, as many contemporary high-­
protein diets call for little to no fat.) Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Use a rubber spatula or a wooden spoon to
gently pull the egg whites into the center of the pan, being careful not to break the curds. Smooth the egg whites into
an even layer and let them finish cooking without stirring. Finish as you would a plain omelet.
Cheese Omelet: Fill each omelet with 1/2 oz/14 g grated or diced cheese such as Gruyère or Cheddar.
Cheese and Vegetable Omelet: Fill each omelet with any combination of cheese and vegetables in a similar flavor
profile, such as goat cheese and sun-­dried tomatoes, Gorgonzola and sautéed spinach or mushrooms, cream cheese
and olives, or Gruyère and sautéed leeks.
Meat and Cheese Omelet: Fill each omelet with 1 oz/28 g diced cooked meat (turkey, ham, or sausage) and 1 oz/28 g
grated cheese.
Herb Omelet: Before rolling, sprinkle each omelet with 2 tsp/2 g finely chopped herbs such as parsley, thyme, chervil,
tarragon, basil, and oregano. Alternatively, the herbs can be added to the eggs before cooking.

724 | EGGS AND THE COLD KITCHEN

Omelet Florentine: Fill each omelet with 1 1/2 oz/43 g sautéed spinach.

1

To make the soufflé base, heat the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and stir in the flour. Cook this
roux over low to medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring frequently, to make a blond roux.

2

Add the milk, whisking well until the mixture is very smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer over low heat,
stirring constantly, until very thick and smooth, 15 to 20 minutes.

3

Blend the yolks with some of the hot base to temper. Stir the tempered yolks into the base mixture and continue to
simmer over very low heat for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Do not allow the mixture to boil.

4

Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and strain through a sieve, if necessary. The base is ready to use now or may
be cooled rapidly and stored for later use.

5

To make the spinach souffles, prepare ten 6-­fl oz/ 180-­mL ramekins by brushing them liberally with soft butter.
Lightly dust the interior of each mold with grated Parmesan.

6

For each portion, blend together 2 fl oz/60 mL soufflé base, 1 oz/28 g spinach, 1 tbsp/30 mL grated Parmesan, salt,
and pepper until the spinach is evenly distributed.

7

Whisk one egg white for each soufflé to soft peaks in a clean mixing bowl. Fold about one-­third of the beaten white
into the base. Stir in the remaining egg white in one or two additions.

8

Spoon the soufflé batter into the prepared molds to within 1/2 inch/1 cm of the rim. Wipe the rim carefully to
remove any batter. Tap the soufflés gently on the counter to settle the batter. Sprinkle the soufflé tops with the
remaining Parmesan.

9

Place the soufflés on a sheet pan in a 425°F/218°C oven and bake undisturbed until puffy and a skewer inserted in
the center comes out relatively clean, 16 to 18 minutes. Serve immediately.
Savory Cheese Soufflé: Replace the 10 oz/284 g blanched chopped spinach with 3 oz/85 g of grated Gruyère or
Emmentaler.

CHAPTER 28

THE COLD
KITCHEN
The cold kitchen, or Garde Manger, is
the station that prepares salads and
sandwiches, among other items like
charcuterie, cold hors d’oeuvres, and
canapés. Essential for brunch, lunch,
and casual dinner service, these
items are integral to brunch, lunch,
and casual dinner service, as well as
catering operations.

SANDWICHES
Sandwiches find their place on nearly every menu, from elegant receptions and teas to
substantial but casual meals. Built from four simple elements—­bread, a spread, a filling, and
a garnish—­they exemplify the ways in which a global approach to cuisine can result in nearly
endless variety.

Elements in a Sandwich
A sandwich can be open or closed, hot or cold. It can be small enough to serve as an hors
d’oeuvre or large enough to serve as an entrée.
Cold sandwiches include standard deli-­style versions made from sliced meats or
mayonnaise-­dressed salads. Club sandwiches, also known as triple-­decker sandwiches, are
included in this category as well.
In warm sandwiches, one of the filling components will be hot while the remaining
components are cold. For example, the warm component could be grilled flank steak or a
fried egg. This type of sandwich is especially delicious precisely because it combines two
temperatures, which also opens up textural variations. These can be the most complicated
sandwiches to assemble, since one item needs to be cooked while the other ingredients are
gathered and assembled.
Hot sandwiches may feature a freshly cooked or heated filling, such as a hamburger or
pastrami. Others are grilled or pressed, like a Reuben sandwich or a melt. Sometimes a hot
filling is mounded on bread and the sandwich is topped with a hot sauce. If the sandwich is to
be pressed with cheese, the cheese should be placed directly below the top slice of bread so
that it can melt down over the other ingredients.

Breads

730 | EGGS AND THE COLD KITCHEN

Bread for sandwiches runs a wide gamut. Sliced white and wheat Pullman loaves are used
to make many cold sandwiches. The tight crumb of a good Pullman makes it a particularly
appropriate choice for delicate tea and finger sandwiches, since they can be thinly sliced
without crumbling. Tea and finger sandwiches must be made on fine-­grained bread to be
trimmed of their crusts and precisely cut into shapes and sizes that can be eaten in about
two average bites. Whole-­grain and peasant-­style breads are not always as easy to slice thin.
Various other breads, buns, rolls, and wrappers are used to make special sandwiches. The
characteristics of the bread and how it will fit with the sandwich should be considered. The
bread should be firm enough and thick enough to hold the filling, but not so thick that the
sandwich is too dry to enjoy.
Most breads can be sliced in advance of sandwich preparation if they are carefully covered to
prevent drying. Toasting should be done immediately before assembling the sandwich. Some
breads to choose from include the following:
• Pullman loaves (white, wheat, or rye)
• Peasant-­style breads (pumpernickel, sourdough, pain de campagne, and boule)
• Rolls (hard, soft, and Kaiser)
• Flatbreads (focaccia, pita, ciabatta, and lavash)
• Wrappers (rice paper and egg roll)
• Flour and corn tortillas

Spreads
Many sandwiches call for a spread applied directly to the bread. A fat-­based spread
(mayonnaise or butter, for instance) provides a barrier to keep the bread from getting
soggy. Spreads also add moisture to a sandwich and help hold it together as it is picked up
and eaten. Some sandwich fillings include the spread in the filling mixture (for example, a
mayonnaise-­dressed tuna salad); there is no need then to add a spread when assembling
the sandwich.
Spreads can be very simple and subtly flavored, or they may themselves bring a special flavor
and texture to the sandwich. The following list of spreads includes some classic choices as
well as some that may not immediately spring to mind as sandwich spreads:
• Mayonnaise (plain or flavored, such as aïoli and rouille) or creamy salad dressings
• Plain or compound butters
• Mustard or ketchup
• Spreadable cheeses (ricotta, cream cheese, mascarpone, or crème fraîche)
• Vegetable or herb spreads (hummus, tapenade, or pesto)
• Tahini and nut butters
• Jellies, jams, compotes, chutneys, and other fruit preserves
• Avocado pulp or guacamole
• Oils and vinaigrettes

chapter 28 • THE COLD KITCHEN | 731

Fillings
Sandwich fillings are the focus of a sandwich. They may be cold or hot, substantial or
minimal. It is as important to properly roast and slice turkey for club sandwiches as it is to be
certain that the watercress for tea sandwiches is perfectly fresh and completely rinsed and
dried. The filling should determine how all the other elements of the sandwich are selected
and prepared. Choices for fillings include the following:
• Cured meats: deli meats
• Charcuterie: duck confit, sausage (which also falls into the cured meats category), pâtés,
or terrines
• Cooked meats: beef, chicken, turkey, pork, fish, seafood, etc.
• Cheese
• Vegetables: raw, cooked, or pickled
• Tofu: fresh, smoked, fried, or marinated
These are certainly not the only types of fillings, but they are some of the most common.

Garnishes
Lettuce leaves, slices of tomato or onion, sprouts, marinated or brined peppers, and olives
are just a few of the many ingredients that can be used to garnish sandwiches. These
garnishes become part of the sandwich’s overall structure, so choose them with some
thought to the way they complement or contrast the main filling. When sandwiches are
plated, side garnishes may also be included. For example:
• Green salad or side salad (potato, pasta, or coleslaw)
• Lettuce and sprouts
• Sliced fresh vegetables
• Pickle spears or olives
• Dips, spreads, or relishes
• Sliced fruits

Presentation Styles
A sandwich constructed with a top and a bottom slice of bread is known as a closed
sandwich. A club sandwich has a third slice of bread. Still other sandwiches have only one
slice of bread, which acts as a base; these are open-­faced sandwiches.
Create straight-­edged sandwiches by cutting them into squares, rectangles, diamonds,
or triangles. The yield may be lower when preparing shapes, making them slightly more
expensive to produce. Take the time to cut shapes uniformly so that they look their best when
set in straight rows on platters or arranged on plates.
Cut sandwiches as close to service as possible. If sandwiches must be prepared ahead of
time, hold them wrapped in plastic or in airtight containers for only a few hours.

732 | EGGS AND THE COLD KITCHEN

Sandwich Production Guidelines
Organize the work station carefully, whether preparing mise en place or assembling
sandwiches for service. Everything needed should be within arm’s reach. Maximize the
workflow by looking for ways to eliminate any unnecessary movements:
• Organize the work so that it moves in a direct line.
• Prepare spreads prior to service and have them at a spreadable consistency. Use a spatula
to spread the entire surface of the bread.
• Slice breads and rolls prior to service for volume production. Whenever possible, toast,
grill, or broil breads when ready to assemble the sandwich. If bread must be toasted in
advance, hold the toast in a warm area, loosely covered.
• Prepare and portion fillings and garnishes in advance and hold them at the correct
temperature. Clean and dry lettuce or other greens in advance.
• Grilled sandwiches, such as a Reuben or croque monsieur, can be fully assembled in
advance of service and grilled or heated to order.

SALADS
Salads appear on the menu in so many different guises today that it is easy to imagine that
they were invented by this generation of chefs. In fact, fresh concoctions of seasoned herbs
and lettuces have been relished in every part of the world from the beginning of recorded
culinary history.

Green Salads
Commercially prepared salad blends are available today, but chefs can also create their
own by combining lettuces from within one group or by selecting from among two or more
groups. For more information on specific salad green varieties, see Lettuce and Bitter Salad
Greens, page 114.
Separate the lettuce or other heading greens into leaves. Loose heads and bunching greens
will separate into individual leaves easily. Trim the coarse ribs or stem ends away if necessary.
To remove the core from heading lettuce, use a paring knife to cut out the core.
Greens and herbs used for salads are often quite sandy and gritty, and nothing is worse than
a gritty salad. All greens, including prepackaged salad mixes, must be washed before serving.
Removing all traces of dirt from them is a very important part of the mise en place for the
pantry and hot line. Wash greens thoroughly in plenty of cool water to remove all traces of
dirt or sand.
Hydroponically raised greens, prepared as mesclun mixes and prerinsed, and “triple-­washed”
bagged spinach, may need only a quick plunge or rinse with cool water to refresh them. Other
leafy greens should be cleaned by plunging them in a sink filled with cool water. Lift them
from the water, drain the sink, and repeat until there are no signs of grit remaining in the
water. Change the water as often as necessary until absolutely no traces of dirt, grit, or sand
are visible in the rinsing water.

Dry the greens completely. Salad dressings cling best to well-­dried greens. In addition,
carefully dried greens last in storage longer. A key piece of equipment in salad making
is the spinner. This tool, which comes in both hand-­operated and large-­scale electric
versions, uses centrifugal force to spin the water away from the greens so that they have
a better flavor and dressing clings evenly to them. Use either a large-­scale electric spinner
for volume salad making or a hand basket for smaller batches. Clean and sanitize the
spinner carefully after each use. If a spinner is not available, drain the greens well, spread
them out in thin layers on sheet pans and air-­dry inside a refrigerator.
Store cleaned greens in tubs or other containers. Once greens are cleaned and dried, keep
them refrigerated until you are ready to dress and serve them. Use cleaned salad greens
within a day or two. Do not stack cleaned salad greens too deep; their own weight could
bruise the leaves.
Cut or tear the lettuce into bite-­size pieces. Diners should never be forced to use a knife to
cut the lettuce. Traditional salad-­making manuals have always called for lettuces to be torn
rather than cut to avoid discoloring, bruising, or crushing the leaves. The choice to either
cut or tear lettuce is primarily a matter of personal style and preference. With today’s
high-­carbon stainless-­steel knives, discoloration is not a problem. As long as the blade is
properly sharpened and a good cutting technique is used, the leaves will be sliced rather
than crushed or bruised.
Garnish and dress the salad. The dressing’s flavor should be appropriate to the salad
ingredients because the dressing serves to pull all the flavors together. Use delicate
dressings with delicately flavored greens and more robust dressings with more strongly
flavored greens. Consider the weight and coating capabilities of different dressings as well.
Vinaigrettes coat lightly but evenly. Emulsified vinaigrette dressings and light mayonnaise
dressings, which are thicker than vinaigrettes, tend to coat the ingredients more heavily.
Choose garnishes according to the season and your desired presentation. Either toss these
ingredients with the greens as they are being dressed or marinate them separately in a
little vinaigrette and use them to top or place around the salad.
To dress a salad:
• Place the greens (about 3 oz/85 g or 6 fl oz/180 mL per serving) in a bowl.
• Ladle a portion of salad dressing over them (1 to 2 fl oz/30 to 60 mL per serving).
• Toss the salad using tongs, spoons, or, if appropriate, gloved hands.
• Be sure each piece of lettuce is coated completely but lightly, with just enough dressing
for the greens; if the dressing pools on the plate, there is too much.

Croutons
Croutons are often used as a garnish for salads as well as soups and stews. Croustades,
crostini, rusks, and bruschetta are all types of croutons. Some are cut into slices, others
into cubes or disks. Some are toasted, some deep fried, some grilled, and some broiled.
(Large croutons, made to act as the base for canapés, hors d’oeuvre, and roasted or grilled
meats, reflect medieval European practices when plates were actually slabs of bread
intended for consumption once they had been well dampened with juices and sauces from
the meal.)
chapter 28 • THE COLD KITCHEN | 735

To make croutons:
• Cut bread (crusts removed or not) into the desired size. Rub, spray, or toss the cubes or
slices lightly with oil or clarified butter, if desired. Add salt and pepper.
• To toast croutons in the oven or under a broiler or salamander, spread them in a single
layer on a sheet pan. Turn them from time to time to toast them evenly and check
frequently to avoid scorching.
• To pan fry croutons, add the bread to hot clarified butter or oil in a sauté pan, fry until
evenly browned, and drain well on paper towels.
• Add herbs or grated cheese while still hot.
Good croutons are light in color, relatively greaseless, and well seasoned with a crisp, crunchy
texture throughout.

FRUIT SALADS
Fruits have a variety of characteristics, making some fruit salads fairly sturdy, while others
lose quality very rapidly. Fruits that turn brown, such as apples, pears, and bananas, can be
treated with citrus juice to keep them from oxidizing, as long as the flavor of the juice doesn’t
compete with the other ingredients in the salad, and they are not prepared too far in advance.
Mixed fruit salads that include highly perishable fruits can be produced for volume
operations by preparing the base from the least perishable fruits. The more perishable items,
such as raspberries, strawberries, or bananas, can then be combined with smaller batches
or individual servings at the last moment, or they can be added as a garnish. Fruits such as
bananas should not be cut and refrigerated but rather added at the last moment.
Fresh herbs such as mint, basil, or lemon thyme may be added to fruit salads as a flavoring
agent and/or garnish. Experiment to determine which herbs work best with the fruits
selected for the salad.
To prepare fruit salads, you must learn how to peel and slice or cut a variety of fruits. Before
working with any fruit, be sure it is properly rinsed. To avoid cross contamination, clean and
sanitize cutting boards and tools properly. Refrigerate cut fruits until they are served.

Apples
To prevent discoloration of the cut surfaces of apples, pears, peaches, and bananas, prepare
them as needed or, if necessary, toss them in water that has been acidulated with a little
citrus juice. Choose a juice with a flavor that complements the fruit’s flavor. There shouldn’t
be so much acid that it overwhelms the fruit.
To clean and peel an apple, use the tip of a paring knife to remove the stem and blossom
ends. Use a paring knife or swivel-­bladed peeler to cut away the skin. Peel apples as thin as
possible to avoid trim loss. Once the peel is removed, halve from top to bottom and cut into
quarters. To core the quarters, work from the stem end, angling your cut to the midpoint of
the core, where it is deepest. Make a second cut working from the opposite direction.
To cut very even slices, use a mandoline. Working with a whole peeled apple, make slices from
one side of the apple until just before the core is reached. Turn and repeat on the opposite
736 | EGGS AND THE COLD KITCHEN

side. When the flesh has been removed from the two wide sides, slice the flesh from the now-­
narrow sides of the apple.

Citrus Fruits
Citrus fruits, including oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruit, are used to add
flavor, moisture, and color to dishes. They are also served as a functional garnish
with some foods—­for instance, a wedge of lemon with broiled fish. Before
juicing citrus fruits, allow them to come to room temperature, if possible. Roll
the fruit under the palm of your hand on a cutting board or other work surface
before juicing to break some of the membranes. This helps to release more
juice. Remember to strain out the seeds and pulp, either by covering the fruit
with cheesecloth before squeezing it or by straining it after juicing. There are
numerous special tools to juice citrus fruits, including reamers, extractors, and
hand-­operated and electric juicers.

Zesting Citrus
Citrus zest is the outer portion of the fruit’s peel or rind. It is used to add color,
texture, and flavor to dishes. The zest includes only the skin’s brightly colored
part, which contains much of the fruit’s flavorful and aromatic volatile oils. It
does not include the underlying white pith, which has a bitter taste. You can use
the fine openings on a box grater or a rasp to make grated zest, or a paring knife,
peeler, or zester for other cuts.
Zest is often blanched before it is used in a dish to remove any unpleasant bitter
flavor. To blanch zest, cook it briefly in simmering water, shock, and drain. Repeat
as often as necessary; generally two to three blanchings are best. Add sugar to
the blanching water for a sweetened zest.

Making Citrus Suprêmes
Cutting the flesh away from all the
connective membranes of the fruit
makes citrus suprêmes, also called
sections or segments.

1

After cutting away the ends of
the fruit, use a paring knife to
remove the peel of the orange. Be
careful to cut away as little flesh
as possible.

2

To make suprêmes, use a paring
knife to cut along each side of
the membrane that divides the
orange segments. Have a bowl
ready to catch the suprêmes
as you work.

Mangos A mango has a flat seed in the center of the flesh. If cut from the stem
end to the pointed end of the mango, the flesh comes away from the pit more easily.
The fruit may be peeled before cutting the flesh from the pit, if desired. The peel is
left on to produce a special decorative cut known as the hedgehog cut. To dice the
mango for puréeing or for a less decorative approach, peel it by making a series of
cuts, removing as little edible fruit as possible. Cut a slice from the other side of the
pit, cutting as close to the pit as possible for the best yield. Cut the remaining flesh
from the two narrow sides, following the curve of the pit. Cube or slice the mango
as desired.
For the hedgehog cut, the mango is not peeled before the flesh is sliced from the pit.
This technique can be used to prepare mangos for salads or other uses, or it may be
used for a decorative presentation on a fruit plate.

1

Use a chef’s knife to carefully slice as close to the pit as possible to remove the
most flesh. If desired, the remainder of the mango can be peeled and the flesh
cut away from the pit in order to improve the yield.

2

Use the tip of a paring knife or a utility knife to score the flesh in a crosshatch
pattern. This may be done on the diagonal, as shown here, or using
perpendicular cuts to produce cubes. The tip of the knife should not cut
through the skin.

3

Turn the mango half inside out; it will look like a hedgehog. Slice the cubes away
from the skin now, or present the fruit as is on a fruit plate.

Pineapples A pineapple has a thick, spiny skin. The flesh near the skin has
“eyes” that should be completely removed before using the flesh in a salad or
other presentations. Slice away the pineapple top with a chef’s knife, and cut a
slice from the base of the pineapple.
Use a chef’s knife to peel the pineapple. Make the cuts deep enough to remove
the eyes but not so deep that a great deal of edible flesh is removed. For even
slices or to make neat dice or cubes, slice the pineapple vertically at the desired
thickness until you reach the core on the first side. Turn the pineapple, and
make slices from the opposite side as well as from both ends. Cut the slices
into neat julienne, batonnet, or dice as desired.

Melons

Melons can be peeled before or after cutting. To make the melon

more stable as you work, cut a slice from both ends. You may remove the entire
rind before halving the melon and removing the seeds to streamline production
of fruit plates and salads. Or you may prefer to leave the rind on.

1

After cutting the top and the bottom off the melon, cut the rind away. Use
a utility or chef’s knife to follow the curve of the melon.

2

Cut the melon in half and scoop out the seeds. Be careful not to gouge the
flesh of the fruit. The melon can now be made into melon balls, cut into
slices, or cut into cubes or diced.

3

Scoop melon balls out of the cleaned melon half using a parisienne scoop.

WARM, VEGETABLE, AND
COMPOSED SALADS
Heartier than green salads, salads in this category contain ingredients like proteins, grains,
and other nutrient-­dense foods that would make them a main menu item, so they can be
presented as a full meal for lunch or dinner. With the exception of composed salads, these types
of salads are best prepared ahead, so they have some time to allow the flavors to fully marry.

Warm Salads
Warm salad is made by tossing the salad ingredients in a warm dressing, working over
medium-­to-­low heat. The salad should be just warmed through. Another approach is to use a
chilled crisp salad as the bed for hot main items such as grilled meat or fish.

Vegetable Salads
Prepare vegetables for this type of salad as required by the specific recipe. Some are simply
rinsed and trimmed. Others need to be peeled, seeded, and cut into the appropriate shape. Some
vegetables require an initial blanching to set colors and textures, while others must be fully cooked.
If the salad is to be served raw, combine the prepared vegetable or vegetables with a
vinaigrette or other dressing and allow them to rest long enough for the flavors to marry.
When the vegetable or vegetables are partially or fully cooked, there are two methods for
applying the dressing. In the first method, simply drain the vegetables and combine them
with the dressing while they are still warm, for faster flavor absorption. This works well for
root vegetables such as carrots, beets, and parsnips, as well as leeks, onions, and potatoes.
Some vegetables, especially green vegetables like broccoli or green beans, may discolor if
they are combined with an acid in advance; in that case, refresh the vegetables before adding
the dressing at service. Always be sure to thoroughly drain and blot dry the vegetables to
avoid watering down the dressing.

Potato Salads
Potatoes must be cooked completely but not overcooked. High-­moisture potatoes hold their
shape after cooking better than low-­moisture potatoes do.
The classic American potato salad is a creamy salad, dressed with mayonnaise. Other potato
salads enjoyed around the world are often dressed with vinaigrette. In some traditional
European-­style recipes, the dressing may be based on bacon fat, olive oil, stock, or a
combination of these ingredients. The dressing may actually be brought to a simmer before
the potatoes are added for the best finished flavor. Potatoes should be dressed before they
completely cool for better absorption of the flavors in the dressing.

Pasta and Grain Salads
Grains and pastas for salads should be fully cooked. However, care should be taken to avoid
overcooking because cooked grains and pasta will still be able to absorb some of the liquid in
the dressing and can quickly become soggy.
If a pasta or grain salad is held for later service, be especially careful to check for seasoning
before it is served. These salads have a tendency to go flat as they sit. Salt and pepper are
740 | EGGS AND THE COLD KITCHEN

important seasonings, of course, but others, such as vinegars, herbs, and citrus
juices, can give a brighter flavor.

Legume Salads
Dried beans should be cooked until they are tender to the bite if serving at
room temperature. If beans are to be served chilled, they should be slightly
overcooked to ensure a creamy texture. The center should be soft and creamy,
and it is even possible that the skins may break open slightly. If a salad is made
of several kinds of dried beans, it is important that beans with different cooking
times be cooked separately to the correct doneness before combining them.
Unlike grains and pastas, which might become too soft as they sit in a dressing,
beans will not soften any further. In fact, the acid in salad dressings will make the
beans become tougher, even if they are fully cooked. Bean salads, therefore, should
not be dressed and allowed to rest for extended periods. If the salad is used within
four hours of preparation, however, there is little significant texture change.

Composed Salads
Composed salads contain carefully arranged items on a plate, rather than
components tossed together. They are usually main-­course salads or
appetizers, rather than an accompaniment.
Although there are no specific rules governing the requirements for a
composed salad, keep the following principles in mind:
• Consider how well each of the elements combines with the others.
Contrasting flavors are intriguing. Conflicting flavors are a disaster.
• Repetition of a color or flavor can be successful if it contributes to the overall
dish. But generally, too much of a good thing is simply too much.
• Each element of the dish should be so perfectly prepared that it could easily
stand on its own. However, each part should be enhanced in combination
with the others.
• Components should be arranged in such a way that the textures and colors
of the foods are most attractive to the eye.

Serving Salads
Mise en place for salads is relatively quick and easy, but one of the most
important factors to consider is that salads are an extremely quick pickup.
To pick up a salad properly, make sure to dress it right before it is plated.

This Niçoise salad is a composed salad.

The general ratio for dressing salads is to use about 30 g/1.06 oz of dressing
per portion; more than that and the components won’t be able to hold it.
Always keep in mind that once a salad is dressed, its lifespan is greatly reduced,
especially if the dressing is vinegar based, such as a vinaigrette. The acid wilts
all it comes in contact with, especially lettuce. Dressing a salad isn’t something
you can get ahead on.
If the salad has a warm component, like fried chicken or grilled vegetables, always
get that component hot, and dress the salad while that component is heating.

Fill a 4-­in/10-­cm-­deep hotel pan halfway with cold water and mix in the lemon juice.

2

Trim the tops and bottoms of the fennel bulbs. Peel off the outer layer. Trim any part of the fennel that is discolored or
brown. Reserve 1 1/2 /43 g oz of fennel fronds in a damp paper towel during service. The fronds should be small, with
3 to 5 strands each.

3

Slice the fennel bulbs on an electric slicer to about 3 mm thick, placing the fennel directly into the lemon juice bath
as soon as it is sliced. Reserve the fennel in the lemon juice bath during service. Consolidate into a smaller hotel pan
as needed for service.

4 Slice the radishes as thinly as possible on a mandoline. Reserve refrigerated and covered with a damp, heavy-­duty
paper towel.

5 Reserve the cauliflower in an airtight container in the refrigerator. The florets must be small because they will be
served raw and are easier to eat that way.

6 Trim the ends of the green beans and cut them into 1-­in/2 1/2-­cm-­long pieces.
7 Bring a pot of abundantly salted water to a rolling boil. Have an ice bath ready.
8 Place the green beans in the boiling water and cook them until just tender. Shock them in an ice bath to stop the
cooking process. Strain and reserve in an airtight container in refrigeration. Discard after service.

9 For the vinaigrette: Place the Meyer lemon juice in a blender cup and turn it on low speed. Slowly turn it up to
high speed.

10 Slowly pour the oil into the blender. Add the salt and pepper, and adjust seasoning if needed. Reserve in the
refrigerator. Discard after 4 days.

BAKING
AND
PASTRY

CHAPTER 29

BAKING MISE
EN PLACE
To be successful in the baking and
pastry arts, it is important to have a
basic understanding of how baking
ingredients function and how they
react to each other. Knowledge
of these principles and processes
will not only help you to follow
any formula and produce better
quality products, but will also aid
in developing formulas of your own
creation.

THE FUNCTIONS OF BAKING
INGREDIENTS
The basic ingredients used in baking typically fulfill more than one function in
the finished product. Eggs, for example, can act as a stabilizer, leavener, and/or
thickener. Understanding how ingredients function will give a chef the ability
to create balanced baking formulas and to understand what went wrong when
something doesn’t work.

Stabilizers
A stabilizer is any ingredient that helps to develop the solid structure, or
“framework,” of a finished product. It does this in one of two ways, either by
toughening or tightening a dough or by thickening a mixture. Flour and eggs
are examples of ingredients that lend structure (and nutritional value) to a
finished product.
Flour acts as a binding and absorbing agent. It is the gluten (the protein
component in flour) that builds structure and strength in baked goods, whereas
the starch present in the flour makes a useful thickener. When starch granules
suspended in water are heated, they begin to absorb liquid and swell, causing
an increase in the viscosity of the mixture. This reaction, known as gelation,
allows starches to be used as thickening agents. Different types of flours
have different gluten-­to-­starch ratios, which will create vastly different results
in the texture, appearance, and flavor of the final product when used in the
same formula.
Although eggs play an important role
in providing structure and flavor, they

products. For example, you can use

banana or applesauce instead of eggs
in baking.
This is how you use aquafaba as a
substitute for eggs:
– Prepare the aquafaba by shaking the
can of garbanzo beans to redistribute
the starches in the liquid. Then strain

known as a partial coagulation, where the proteins hold moisture; if the mixture
were cooked or baked further, the proteins would fully coagulate and expel
water, causing the product to curdle.
Eggs also have leavening power. As eggs (whole, yolks, or whites) are whipped,
they trap air that expands when heated, resulting in a larger and lighter
product. Several other typical stabilizers/thickeners are the following.

the liquid.
– If you’re using aquafaba from dry
garbanzo beans that you cooked, you
might have to reduce the liquid to
thicken it.
– To use aquafaba as a binder, slightly
whip it until it foams before adding it.

Arrowroot and Cornstarch
These are generally preferable for thickening sauces, puddings, and fillings
where a translucent effect is desired. To dilute these thickeners before
incorporating them with other ingredients, mix them with a small amount of
cool liquid. Tapioca starch is also commonly used to thicken pie fillings.

– To make meringue, use cream of tartar
to help stabilize it.
Three tablespoons of aquafaba is equal
to one whole egg.

764 | BAKING AND PASTRY

Gelatin
Gelatin is used to produce light, delicate foams that are firmly set, such as
Bavarian cream, mousse, and stabilized whipped cream. Such foams retain the

shape of a mold even after unmolding and can be sliced. Available in both powder and sheets,
gelatin must first be softened or bloomed in a cool liquid. Once the gelatin has absorbed the
liquid, it is gently heated to melt the crystals, either by adding the softened gelatin to a hot
mixture, such as a hot custard sauce, or by gently heating the gelatin over simmering water.

Pectin
Pectin is a carbohydrate derived from the cell walls of certain fruits. Some common sources
of pectin are apples, cranberries, and currants. It requires the correct balance of sugar and
acid to gel.

Liquefiers
Liquefiers help to loosen or tenderize a dough or batter. Water, milk, and other liquids, fats,
and sugar act as liquefiers.
Although sugar tends to tighten up a mixture when it is first incorporated, through its
interaction with other ingredients and the heat of baking, it ultimately acts to loosen or
liquefy a batter or dough.
Water acts to dilute or liquefy water-­soluble ingredients such as sugar and salt. It also
facilitates the even distribution of sugar, salt, and yeast in a dough if these ingredients are
mixed thoroughly with the water before introducing the remaining ingredients in the formula.
Water also acts to leaven, as it changes to steam and expands.
Milk performs many of the same functions as water, but because of its additional
components (fat, sugar, minerals, and protein), it serves a number of other functions and
adds flavor as well. As the sugar (lactose) in milk caramelizes, it gives a rich color to the
product’s surface, and it can also aid in development of a firm crust. The lactic acid in milk
has a tightening effect on the proteins in flour, which serves to increase stability, resulting in a
product with a fine grain and texture.
If the total amount of fat added to a dough or batter equals no more than 3 percent of the
weight of the finished dough or product, it acts to increase the elasticity of the proteins in
the flour, thereby helping the product expand during baking. In baking, fats and oils are also
classified as shortening agents, a term derived from their ability to split the long, elastic
gluten strands that can toughen flour-­based doughs and batters. This tenderizing effect
renders the strands more susceptible to breaking (shortening), resulting in a more tender
and less dense crumb.

Leaveners (Biological, Chemical, Mechanical)
To leaven is to raise or to make lighter. There are several ways to accomplish this in baking:
with yeasts (also known as biological leaveners), with chemical agents such as baking powder
or baking soda, and through steam, also known as mechanical leavening. Each method is
best suited to specific applications and all produce very different results. Different leavening
methods may be used alone or in conjunction with one another to yield particular effects.

Biological Leaveners
Organic leaveners are based on yeast, a living organism that feeds on sugars and produces
alcohol and carbon dioxide, the gas that lightens a dough to give it the proper texture. Unlike

chapter 29 • BAKING MISE EN PLACE | 765

chemical leaveners, organic leaveners take a substantial amount of time to do their job. The
yeast has to grow and reproduce sufficiently to fill the dough with air pockets. For this to
take place, the temperature must be controlled carefully. Yeast will not function well between
50° and 60°F/10° and 16°C, and above 140°F/60°C the yeast is destroyed.
Fresh or compressed yeast must be kept refrigerated (ideally at 40°F/4°C) to maintain its
viability. It may be held for seven to ten days, or it may be frozen for longer storage. This type
of yeast comes in cake form and is usually measured by weight rather than volume.
Active dry yeast and instant yeast are two types of granular yeast. They should be kept
refrigerated after opening and must be kept dry until use. Active dry or instant yeast
in an unopened package is in a completely dormant stage and may be stored at room
temperature, unopened, for up to one year.

Chemical Leaveners
With baking soda and baking powder, an alkaline ingredient (usually sodium bicarbonate)
interacts with an acid already present in baking powder, or in an ingredient such as
buttermilk, sour cream, yogurt, or chocolate, to leaven the product. (Baking powder is a
combination of an alkali, an acid, and a starch.) The alkali and acid produce carbon dioxide
when combined in the presence of liquid. When heated during baking, the carbon dioxide
expands and gives the baked good its characteristic texture, known as crumb. This process of
expansion happens rapidly; hence, many items prepared with chemical leaveners are called
“quick breads.”
Baking powder is referred to as “double acting,” because a first action occurs in the presence
of moisture in the batter and a second action is initiated by the presence of heat. That is,
the baking powder reacts once when it is mixed with the batter’s liquids and again when the
batter is placed in a hot oven.

Mechanical Leaveners
Steam, which is produced when liquids in a batter or dough are heated, is a mechanical
leavener that is sometimes referred to as a physical leavener. Steam is the leavening agent
in sponge cakes and soufflés. It also plays a vital role in puff pastry, croissants, and Danish
pastry, where the steam is trapped between layers of dough, causing them to separate and
rise. When air is incorporated into a batter through either whipping or creaming an ingredient
before it is incorporated into the final batter, heat causes the air pockets in the batter or
dough to expand.

PREPARATION OF BAKING
INGREDIENTS
The most accurate way to measure ingredients is to weigh them. Even liquid ingredients
are often, though not always, weighed. Various types of scales are used in the bakeshop,
including balance-­beam, spring, and electronic scales. Other measuring tools, including
volume measures such as pints, quarts, and measuring spoons, are also necessary and
commonly used.

766 | BAKING AND PASTRY

It is important to properly scale out each ingredient to prepare a baked item. It is equally
important to scale out the finished dough or batter to ensure that the proper and consistent
amount is used for the pan size, mold, or individual portion. This not only contributes to the
uniformity of products, but it also decreases the possibility of uneven rising or browning
caused by too much or too little dough or batter.

Sifting Dry Ingredients

Dry ingredients used for most baked goods should be sifted before they are incorporated
into the dough or batter. Sifting aerates flour and confectioners’ sugar, removing lumps
and filtering out any impurities. Sifting should take place after the ingredients have been
properly scaled.

Separating Whole Eggs
Eggs separate most easily when they are taken directly from refrigeration. In addition to the
cold eggs, have four well-­cleaned containers on hand for separating eggs: one to catch the
white as each egg is separated plus three more to separately hold all the clean whites, all
whites with some yolk, and all yolks.
Crack the eggshell and pull it apart into two halves. Pour the egg from one half into the other,
allowing the white to fall into one of the containers. When all of the white has separated from
the yolk, drop the yolk into its container. Examine the white to be sure that it has no bits of
chapter 29 • BAKING MISE EN PLACE | 767

yolk. If it is clean, drop it into the container that will hold only clean whites. Otherwise, put it
into the container for whites to use for other egg preparations.

Cooking Sugar
Sugar has an important function in baking recipes, but it also stands alone as the primary
ingredient in many items, like caramel, marshmallows, and other confections. When
heated and combined with water, sugar forms a syrup that can be cooked to a range of
temperatures. Each temperature represents the moisture level of the sugar solution: the
lower the temperature, the more water still present in the solution. At its highest temperature,
the sugar solution is free of all moisture, which allows the sugar to brown and caramelize.
The moisture level of a hot sugar solution is important because it determines the texture of
the sugar when it cools. As the sugar continues to cook to specific temperatures, the sugar
syrup changes texture. Once cooled, it can range from wet and syrupy, to pliable as putty, to
hard like a lollipop. Each of the following stages has different applications in baking, pastry,
and candy making:
234°F/112°C

Thread

238°F/114°C

Soft ball

248°F/120°C

Firm ball

260°F/127°C

Hard ball

275°F/135°C

Soft crack

310°F/154°C

Hard crack

Sugar may be cooked by one of the two methods: dry or wet. The dry method is used
exclusively for caramelization. The wet method is generally used when sugar must be cooked
to a specific stage or temperature. The wet method may be used to caramelize sugar, but
the nutty, roasted flavor characteristic of good caramel is better achieved through the
dry method.

Caramelizing Sugar by the Dry Method
Put a small amount of the sugar in a preheated pan over medium heat and allow it to melt.
Then add the remaining sugar in small increments, allowing each addition of sugar to fully
melt before adding the next. Cook to the desired color.
When caramelizing sugar, regardless of the cooking method, stop the cooking process by
shocking the pan in an ice water bath just before it reaches the desired color. Sugar retains
heat and can become too dark or burn if the cooking process is not arrested.

Cooking Sugar to Stages
For the wet method, combine the sugar in a saucepan with about 30 percent of its weight in
water, or enough to give the appearance of wet sand. Place the pan over high heat and stir
constantly until the mixture comes to a boil to ensure all the sugar is melted. Once it comes
to a boil, stop stirring and skim off any impurities.
Use a pastry brush to wash down the sides of the pan with cool water, to prevent crystals
from forming. Crystallization of the cooking sugar occurs readily on the side of the pan,
where crystals from evaporating liquid are deposited. These crystals, in turn, can easily act
768 | BAKING AND PASTRY

Use a pastry brush to wash down the sides of the pan with cool water, to prevent crystals from forming.

to “seed” the rest of the sugar in the pan, causing it to begin to become lumpy and granular.
Repeat washing down the sides as often as necessary to keep them clean, until the sugar has
reached the desired temperature, consistency, and/or color.

Simple Syrup
Simple syrups are an indispensable preparation in every pastry kitchen. They are a mixture
of water and sugar heated only enough to allow the sugar to dissolve completely. Various
liqueurs, such as orange liqueur, brandy, rum, or coffee-­flavored liqueur, may be added to
the syrup for flavor after it has cooled. If desired, flavoring ingredients such as a sachet of
cinnamon and clove, a pinch of saffron, or a split vanilla bean may be steeped in the liquid.
Add the flavoring to the mixture while it is hot, cover the pan, and let it stand for 15 to
20 minutes. Strain to remove any particles, if desired. Syrups of this type are used to add
flavor, moisture, and sweetness to cakes before filling and finishing, to act as a simple wash
for puff pastry as it bakes, and to serve as a poaching medium for fruits.

Melting and Tempering Chocolate
Through a combination of agitation and temperature manipulation, tempering helps to
crystalize the cocoa butter in chocolate. When it sets, tempered chocolate is firm and glossy.
Out of temper chocolate is less stable, with an unappealing discoloration called bloom, which
is cocoa butter rising to the outside of the chocolate. Chocolate is purchased in temper, but
in order to work with it, it must be melted and then tempered again, so that as it cools and
sets it will return to the same state as when purchased.
chapter 29 • BAKING MISE EN PLACE | 769

From left to right, the chocolate on the spoons is out of temper, partially tempered, and fully tempered.

To properly temper chocolate, it must also be melted properly to ensure that it is not
overheated, which would ruin the quality of the chocolate. Before melting, chocolate should
be finely chopped. The smaller the pieces, the more surface area is exposed and the quicker
the chocolate melts, helping to prevent overheating. A hot water bath or a microwave is best
for melting chocolate.
When using a hot water bath, it is important to remember that moisture (steam, water, or
condensation) must never come in contact with the chocolate. Moisture causes chocolate to
“seize,” or to become thick and grainy, rendering it unfit for tempering and most other uses.
For this reason, when using a double boiler be sure that the bowl or top of the double boiler
is completely dry and fits snugly over the pan of water, forming a tight seal. The water should
be steaming hot but not simmering. Gently stir the chocolate occasionally as it melts for even
melting. Remove the chocolate from the heat promptly once it is fully melted.
When using a microwave to melt chocolate, use medium power rather than high and heat the
chocolate for 30-­second intervals, removing and stirring it after each interval to ensure even
heating and melting.

770 | BAKING AND PASTRY

GANACHE
Ganache, a blend of cream and chocolate, has many uses. It may be used as a sauce or to
glaze a cake, or it may be whipped and used as a filling and/or icing. Ganache can also be
made with a stiffer consistency, chilled, and rolled into truffles. Light ganache is sometimes
used as a chocolate sauce.
There are a number of recipes for this all-­time favorite dessert sauce, and by varying the
proportions in the recipe so that there is more chocolate in relation to the amount of cream,
a harder ganache can be made. This hard ganache can be paddled and used for icing or filling
a cake (see page 846). Adding an even greater amount of chocolate will produce the heavy
ganache used to prepare chocolate truffles.
Chocolate for ganache should be cut into very small pieces, which facilitates even melting.
One of the most efficient ways to chop chocolate is to use a serrated knife; the serration
causes the chocolate to break into small shards as it is cut. Use the best-­quality chocolate
available to be sure of a smooth, richly flavored sauce. Place the chopped chocolate into a
heatproof bowl. Place the cream and butter (if using) in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
Infusion is an effective method of flavoring ganache. Bring the cream to a boil, add the
flavoring, and remove the pan from the heat. Cover and allow to stand until the flavor has
been infused into the cream (5 to 10 minutes). Strain, if necessary. After straining, water or
milk should be added as necessary to bring the liquid to its original weight so the finished
ganache will be the proper consistency. Ideal ingredients for infusions include teas, herbs,
and spices.
Depending on the desired result, liqueurs or spirits can be added for flavoring. Pastes and
compounds can also be added. Because these are strongly flavored, they are usually added
to taste to the finished ganache.

Method 1

772 | BAKING AND PASTRY

Method 2

Whipped Cream
Heavy cream can be whipped to soft, medium, or firm peaks for use in sweet and savory
applications. Cream to be whipped must be well chilled, as should the bowl and whip. Working
with cold cream and cold equipment helps to produce a more stable foam that is easier to
fold into other products.
Begin by whipping the cream at a medium and steady speed, working either by hand or with
an electric mixer. Once the cream starts to thicken, increase the speed and continue to whip
until the desired thickness and stiffness is reached. The various stages of whipped cream are
as follows.

Soft Peak
The cream forms peaks that fall gently to one side when the beater is lifted. Soft peak cream
is typically used as a sauce to pool under or spoon over desserts, or as the lightener for sweet
and savory mousses with a smooth, creamy consistency.

Medium Peak
As the cream passes through the soft peak stage, it becomes stiffer and holds peaks for a
longer time and with less drooping when the beaters are lifted, but the peaks should not
stand up perfectly straight. Sugar is best added at this stage. Cream whipped to medium
peaks is often used to cover cakes and tortes or as a garnish (either a dollop dropped from a
spoon or a puff piped through a pastry bag).

Stiff Peak
When cream is beaten to stiff peaks, the foam loses some of its flexibility. As cream reaches
the stiff peak stage, it will lose some of its gloss and velvety texture. Stiff peak cream is used
to top pies and tarts, as well as to make buttercream.

Whipping Egg Whites and Making Meringues
There are several uses in the kitchen and bakeshop for whipped egg whites. They are the
leavener for soufflés and sponge cakes and they can be used to create the light texture in
some mousses and Bavarians. Meringues are made by incorporating enough sugar to both
stabilize and sweeten the foam.
Egg whites must be completely free of any trace of yolk in order to whip successfully. Whites
whip to the greatest volume when they are at room temperature; whites taken directly from
refrigeration can be tempered by warming them over a bowl of hot water.
The bowl and whip must also be completely free of any grease or fat. Some chefs wipe the
bowl and whip with white vinegar, followed by a rinse with very hot water, to remove all traces
of grease. The bowl should be large enough to hold the beaten egg whites, which can expand
eight to ten times in volume. If you are using an acid in the meringue, it should be added
before whipping.

chapter 29 • BAKING MISE EN PLACE | 773

Begin whipping at a low to medium speed, just until the whites start to loosen
and become foamy. Increase the speed and continue to whip until the whites
hold soft or medium peaks. If egg whites are overbeaten, they become dull,
grainy, and dry looking. Overbeaten egg whites collapse quickly and separate
as they are folded into a base or batter, adversely affecting the texture of the
finished item.
Beat egg whites only if you are ready to use them immediately. For example, the
whites for a soufflé are beaten, added to the base, and immediately baked for
the best volume.
Adding sugar to beaten egg whites makes the foam more stable. These egg
white foams are known as meringues. Meringues differ according to how the
sugar is added to the whites.
To prepare a meringue, first separate the eggs carefully and be sure that the
whites, the bowl, and the whip are all very clean. Different types of meringues
are made in the following ways:

Soft peak meringue barely holds its shape.
The peaks tip over when the whip is lifted.

774 | BAKING AND PASTRY

Meringue whipped to medium peak becomes
stiffer and retains its shape for a longer time
when the beater is lifted from the bowl.

Stiff peak meringue will hold a peak that
comes to a sharp point.

soft, medium, or stiff peaks, as required by the recipe.

Swiss Meringue
To prepare a Swiss meringue, combine the whites and sugar in a mixer bowl and
warm the mixture over simmering heat until it reaches 140°F/60°C (depending
on the intended use), stirring frequently to be sure that the sugar is completely
dissolved into the egg whites. The amount of sugar is almost greater than the
amount of egg whites.
Once the egg whites are warmed, transfer the bowl to a mixer and whip on
medium speed until the meringue has soft, medium, or stiff peaks, as required.

Italian Meringue
Italian meringue is produced by whipping a hot sugar syrup into egg whites.
This meringue requires more careful timing than a common or Swiss meringue,
and the end product has a finer grain and is much more stable. Prepare a sugar
syrup with three-­quarters of the sugar using the wet cooking method and heat
it to 240°F/116°C. When the syrup reaches 230°F/110°C, beat the egg whites to
soft peaks with the remaining sugar. Once the syrup is properly cooked, pour
it gradually into the whites while the mixer is running. Continue to beat the
meringue until it holds soft, medium, or stiff peaks, as required.

Choosing and Preparing Pans
Picking a pan of the correct shape and size is essential to ensuring the right
texture and appearance. If a pan is too large, the cake or bread may not rise
properly during baking and the edges may become overbaked. On the other
hand, if a pan is too small, the item may not bake through and the appearance
will suffer.
Pans are lined with parchment paper to ease the process of removing a baked
product. For batters that must be spread rather than poured, it is important to
apply a thin film of butter or other fat to the pan before placing the parchment
in the base of the pan. The fat will keep the paper stationary while the batter is
spread. The sides of a pan should also be greased and lightly floured. Pans used
for sponge cakes should be lined with parchment, but the sides of the pans
should remain untreated. Angel food cakes require no pan preparation. The full
rise of this cake is partially dependent on the batter being able to cling to the
side of the pan as it rises during baking.

Using Pastry Bags and Tips

Borders piped using a star tip.

Borders piped using a straight tip.

Pastry bags and assorted tips have many uses in the kitchen beyond decorating cakes.
They are also used to add fillings to other foods, portion out batters such as pâte à choux or
duchesse potatoes before baking, fill pastry shells for éclairs or profiteroles, and apply small
amounts of garnish or finish ingredients on hors d’oeuvre and canapés.
Extruding a frosting, batter, dough, or other soft mixture through a pastry bag is referred to
as piping. It takes practice to develop the sure movements used to create decorative effects.
To fill a pastry bag, select the desired tip and position it securely in the pastry bag’s opening
or in a coupler. Fold down the bag’s top to create a cuff, then transfer the preparation to the
bag with a spatula or spoon. Twist the bag to compress the mixture and to release any air
pockets before beginning to pipe. Use your dominant hand to hold the bag and squeeze out
the contents of the bag. Use your other hand to guide and steady the tip. Release pressure on
the bag as you lift it away cleanly to avoid making tails.

Hot Water Bath
A hot water bath, or bain-­marie, ensures gentle heat at a constant temperature, allowing for
even baking or cooking. Using a hot water bath for baking custards also prevents both the
formation of a crust and cracking of the custard’s surface.

776 | BAKING AND PASTRY

Select a pan with sides at least as high as the sides of the molds. Set the molds in the pan
as they are filled, leaving about 1 in/3 cm around each mold so it will be surrounded by hot
water. Set the pan securely on the oven deck or rack. Add enough very hot or boiling water
to the pan to come to about two-­thirds of the height of the molds. Be careful not to splash or
pour any water into the custards.
After custards are properly baked and removed from the oven, they should be removed
from the hot water bath. This will stop the cooking process and allow the custards to cool.
Custards will continue to cook if left in the hot water bath after they are removed from the
oven, which may cause them to become overdone.

BAKING
TECHNIQUES
Like in the savory kitchen, there are
key techniques in the pastry kitchen
that, once mastered, provide the
blueprint for an endless assortment
of sweet and savory breads, pastries,
and other desserts. A strong
foundation of baking and pastry
techniques is important in any chef’s
career.

DOUGHS AND BATTERS
Most pastry doughs and batters contain many common ingredients: flour, fat,
liquid, and eggs. What makes each unique is the proportion in which each of
the ingredients is used in relation to the others, the flavorings used, and the
method for mixing or combining the ingredients.

Rubbed-­Dough Method (Cutting-­In)
Biscuits, scones, soda breads, and pie doughs can be prepared using a rubbed-­
dough, or cutting-­in, method. The ingredients are not blended into a smooth
batter. Instead, the fat is chilled and then rubbed into the flour to create flakes
that will produce a tender, flaky baked item.
• Flour, a cold solid fat, and a very cold liquid are the basic components of
most rubbed-­dough products. Any leavener should be weighed or measured
and blended evenly throughout the flour either by sifting it with the flour
or by blending with a whisk. Other dry ingredients (salt, spices, etc.) are
typically scaled out and blended with the flour in the same manner.
• Butter, shortening, or lard (or a combination) are the most common fats
used for this mixing method; they should be broken or cut into pieces and
kept cold.
• Keep the fat very cold. It is imperative that the fat remain cold through the
mixing and shaping process whether you are making biscuits or pie dough. It
is the distinct layers that are created through the rubbing process that create
the flaky texture. Once the fat becomes too warm, it will begin to blend with
the flour and other ingredients, becoming more of a homogeneous mass,
which will compromise the final texture of the finished product.
• Liquids just should be kept very cold before adding. Water, milk, and
buttermilk are all common liquid ingredients. Combine the liquid with the
other ingredients just enough to allow the moisture to be absorbed by the
flour and just until the ingredients come together, at which point the dough
should be allowed to rest in the refrigerator.
• There are two basic types of rubbed doughs: flaky and mealy. The larger the
flakes of fat before the liquid is added, the flakier and crisper the baked dough
will be. If the flakes of butter or shortening are rubbed into the dough so that they
remain visible, the result will be what is often referred to as “flaky” pie dough.
If the butter or shortening is more thoroughly worked into the dough, until the
mixture resembles coarse meal, the result will be what is sometimes referred
to as “mealy” dough. Rubbed doughs for pies or tarts should be rolled out on a
lightly floured work surface to approximately 1/8 in/3 mm thick.

792 | BAKING AND PASTRY

• Pie pans and tart pans require no preparation because a dough of this type
contains a great amount of fat. Properly preheat ovens and adjust the rack to
the center position in conventional ovens.
• Have wire cooling racks available. Remove scones, biscuits, and breads
from their baking pans and cool directly on the racks; pies and tarts cool

Flaky pie dough is best for pies and
tarts that are filled with a fruit filling
and baked. Mealy dough is best suited
for pies and tarts that require a fully
baked shell that is filled after cooling and
chilled until set, and for pies with custard

on racks in their pans. Tarts may be removed from their pans after they are

THE BLENDING
MIXING METHOD
The blending method consists of making two mixtures, one with the wet
ingredients and one with the dry ingredients, then combining the two together.
The dry ingredients typically include flour, sugar, salt, chemical leaveners, and
flavoring such as spices and cocoa.
• The fat is added in liquid form: either oil or melted butter. The fat is added

the baked goods.

• All-­purpose or pastry flour is used for most items made by this method
because of their moderate protein content. Special flours such as cornmeal
or whole wheat flour may replace some or all of the white wheat flour in a
given formula to add flavor and develop a different texture.
• It is important to sift the dry ingredients to remove lumps and incorporate
the dry ingredients together. Thoroughly blending the dry ingredients also
ensures that the leavening agent will be evenly distributed in the mixture.
Sifting will ultimately help to create a fully combined batter needing minimal
mixing time.
• Cream, milk, buttermilk, water, and even watery vegetables like zucchini are
all considered wet ingredients. Solid fats like butter or shortening are most
often melted for this method so they can be blended with the other liquid

796 | BAKING AND PASTRY

THE CREAMING METHOD
Muffins, cakes, quick breads, cookies, and other baked goods made with the creaming
method develop their light and airy structure from the use of chemical leaveners and the
incorporation of air into the batter or dough.
• It is important that ingredients for a creamed batter or dough are at the proper
temperature before you begin to mix. Fats should be softened to 65° to 70°F/18 to 21°C
and the eggs and liquids (if using) should be warmed to 70°F/21°C.
• The sugar used in creaming recipes is often granulated white sugar, although brown
sugar or confectioners’ sugar may be used in some recipes. It is the act of beating the
granules of sugar into the fat that produces the final texture.
• Flavorings such as vanilla extract or chocolate should be at room temperature. Chocolate
is typically melted and allowed to cool slightly before being blended into the batter. Liquid
flavoring should be added with the eggs and the dry ingredients should be added with the
flour.
• Mixing time in batters allows for the development of air cells that are key to the
structure of a finished baked item. They help to develop the crumb and texture during
baking. However, it is important to restrict the mixing time after the flour has been added
to prevent development of gluten, which would make the baked item tough or chewy.
• Generally, pans for creamed batters are greased and lightly floured, or greased, lined with
parchment that has been cut to size, and then greased again.

Increase the mixer speed and beat the batter just until it is evenly blended and
smooth. Regardless of the method of addition, after adding the dry ingredients
the dough or batter should be mixed minimally or just until the dry ingredients
are incorporated.
Finally, add any remaining flavoring or garnishing ingredients, such as nuts,
chocolate chips, or dried fruit, mixing or folding just until incorporated.

THE FOAMING METHOD
A foaming method is any method in which the eggs are whipped or beaten to
incorporate air before they are folded into the rest of the batter. When you use
a foaming method, it is vital that all ingredients and equipment are assembled
and receive any preliminary treatment before you begin to mix the batter.
• Cakes prepared by the foaming method are often more spongy than other
cakes, although they do have a discernible crumb. Angel food and chiffon
cakes are the spongiest of these types.
• The limited amount of fat used gives these cakes a slightly dry texture,
which is why they are often moistened with simple syrup. Even though
there is a large proportion of eggs in foamed cakes, there should not be an
unpleasant egg flavor.
• For maximum volume of the egg whites while folding into the batter, use a
large flat spatula. Incorporate a small amount of meringue into the batter to
lighten it before folding in the remaining meringue. For maximum volume in
the finished batter, fold in the meringue quickly and gently.
• There are three basic types of foaming methods: cold, warm, and
separated.
• Cold foaming method: Whole eggs are whipped to maximum volume with
the sugar before being folded into the batter.
• Warm foaming method: The egg mixture is heated over a water bath before
it is whipped to maximum volume, to create a more stable foam.
• Separated method: The yolks and whites are whipped separately with
sugar for maximum aeration.

800 | BAKING AND PASTRY

• Pans for foamed batters should be prepped as called for in the specific
recipe: greased and lined or dusted with flour. If called for, butter should be
melted and slightly cooled. Dry ingredients such as flour, additional leavener,
and ground spices should be sifted together.

For separated foaming methods, it is
imperative that no trace of yolk be in the
whites. The yolk contains fat that will
prevent the egg whites from whipping to
full volume.

Prepared pans allow for easy removal. Cool the cakes fully before using.

PÂTE À CHOUX
Pâte à choux is a precooked batter that expands from the steam released in
the dough to form a hollow shell when baked. It can be filled, as for profiteroles
(cream puffs), or not, as for gougères.
• Pâte à choux is made by cooking water, butter, flour, and eggs into a smooth
batter, then shaping and baking it. The shapes expand during baking, to create
a delicate shell. Pâte à choux is soft enough that a pastry bag can be used to
pipe it into different shapes. Among the most common shapes are cream puffs,
profiteroles, and éclairs.
• Water and milk are the two most common liquids used for making pâte à
choux. Each produces significantly different results; each is best suited for
different uses, depending on your needs. You can also make pâte à choux
with half water and half milk for a result somewhere between the two.

WATER
For pâte à choux made with water, the temperature of the oven should be
reduced during baking. Start with a higher temperature when you first put
the pastries in the oven. This encourages more steam and greater expansion
of the dough. After the dough is fully puffed, lower the temperature to dry out
the pastry completely, for a very light and crisp result.

MILK
Milk causes the pastry to brown more quickly, before the pastry has a
chance to completely dry out. The result is that pâte à choux made with milk
will be slightly moist and tender. The solids present in milk will also impart
more flavor.
• All-­purpose flour may be used to make pâte à choux, but bread flour is the best
choice because it has a higher percentage of protein. Flours with more protein are
able to absorb more liquid, which allows more eggs to be added. More eggs will
result in a lighter finished pastry, and the higher gluten content will make a more
elastic dough, which facilitates expansion during baking.
For cocoa powder: substitute for
2 oz/57 g of the flour and increase
sugar by 1 1/2 oz/43 g).

• Other ingredients can be added to change the flavor and appearance of the
pâte à choux, such as cheese, fresh herbs, fried spices, and cocoa powder.
• Before beginning a pâte à choux, sift the flour. Line the sheet pans with
parchment. Assemble a mixer fitted with a bowl and paddle before the
cooking process begins.
• The pot for cooking the batter needs to be large enough to hold the liquid,
fat, and flour, with enough room to stir vigorously with no spillage.
• Raw batter may be piped and frozen. Baked pâte à choux can be frozen and
refreshed in the oven.

This color does not change drastically during baking. The dough will have
swelled to several times its original volume during baking. Properly baked
pâte à choux appears perfectly dry, without moisture beads on the sides
or top. Proper baking produces a dry, delicate texture. Eggs should be the
predominant flavor of pâte à choux.

LAMINATED DOUGHS
Laminated doughs include puff pastry, croissant, and Danish. To make a laminated dough,
fold and roll a prepared dough (the initial dough) together with a block of fat, called a roll-­in.
Through a series of folds (“turns”), multiple layers of dough and fat are created that causes
expansion and creates the ultimate flaky texture characteristic of laminated doughs.
• Creating the proper number of fat and dough layers is critical to the success of
laminated doughs. With too few layers, the steam will escape and the pastry will not rise.
Folding the dough too many times can be a problem because the layers of fat and dough
merge together as the fat begins to become incorporated into the dough, preventing the
dough from rising.
• A number of different types of fats may be used in lamination. However, butter lends the
best flavor and mouth feel.
• The butter must not be allowed to become so soft that it begins to ooze from the dough
as it is rolled, nor should it be so firm that it could tear the dough or break into bits during
rolling. Before use, the roll-­in may be allowed to stand at room temperature for a few
minutes if it is too hard, or re-­refrigerated if it becomes too soft.
• The dough must be rolled out evenly and the corners kept squared throughout the lock-­
in (the stage at which the roll-­in butter is introduced to the dough) and all subsequent folds
to ensure proper layering.
• The step that introduces the roll-­in (lamination fat) to the dough is the lock-­in. The
roll-­in fat and the dough must be of the same consistency. Let the roll-­in stand at room
temperature for a few minutes if it is too hard, or refrigerate it if it is too soft.
• Finished doughs should be tightly wrapped and refrigerated until use.

gently rolled into the desired shape for the lock-­in before it is refrigerated
to reduce the amount of manipulation necessary during lock-­in and
lamination. While the dough is resting, prepare the roll-­in fat.

2

To prepare the roll-­in, mix the butter and flour (if using) until smooth. A
small amount of flour may be added to the butter to make it easier to work
with and to absorb excess moisture in the butter. It is important that the
fat be completely smooth, as any lumps will tear the dough as it is rolled in,
preventing proper layering.
Transfer the roll-­in to a sheet of parchment paper. Cover with a second
sheet and roll into a rectangle. Square off the edges, cover with plastic
wrap, and refrigerate until firm but still pliable. Do not allow the roll-­in
to become cold. The temperature of the roll-­in is also very important.
It should be the same consistency as the dough when the two are
rolled together.

3

To lock the roll-­in into the dough, turn out the dough onto a lightly floured
work surface and roll it into a square or rectangle, keeping the edges
straight and the corners squared. The roll-­in fat can be added to the dough
using one of several methods: envelope, single-­fold, or three-­fold.
For the envelope method, the dough is rolled into a square or a
rectangle. The roll-­in is rolled into a smaller square or rectangle, and placed
diagonally in the center of the dough so that each corner points to the
center of a side of the dough. The corners of the dough are then folded
over the fat envelope-­style so that they meet in the center.

4

Administer a four-­fold. Cover the dough in plastic wrap and allow it to rest
for 30 minutes under refrigeration. For a four-­fold or book-­fold, divide the
sheet of pastry visually into quarters, and fold the outer quarters into the
middle so that their edges meet. Then fold the dough over as if closing
a book. This type of fold quadruples the number of layers in the dough
each time.

Turn the dough 90 degrees from its position before it was refrigerated
and roll it out into a rectangle, making sure the edges are straight and the
corners are squared. Administer a second fold (three-­fold or four-­fold).
Cover the dough in plastic wrap and allow it to rest for 30 minutes under
refrigeration. Repeat this process two more times for a total of four folds,
turning the dough 90 degrees each time before rolling and allowing the
dough to rest, covered in plastic wrap under refrigeration, for 30 minutes
between each fold.
Each time, before folding and rolling the dough, brush any excess
flour from its surface. When you fold the dough, the corners should meet
squarely and the edges should be straight and perfectly aligned. After each
fold, refrigerate the dough to allow it to relax and the butter to chill; the
length of time the dough will need to rest will depend in large part on the
temperature of the kitchen.

Method 5

For each fold, the dough is turned 90 degrees from the previous one
to ensure that the gluten is stretched equally in all directions. Too much
stress in one direction will make the dough difficult to roll and cause it
to rise unevenly and become misshapen during baking as the gluten
contracts.

chapter 30 • BAKING TECHNIQUES | 811

STRAIGHT MIXING METHOD
FOR LEAN YEAST BREADS
Yeast doughs may be divided into two categories: lean doughs and enriched
doughs. Lean doughs can be produced with only flour, yeast, salt, and water; in
fact, those are the ingredients for a classic French baguette. Other ingredients,
such as spices, herbs, special flours, and/or dried nuts and fruits, can be added
to vary this dough, but they will not greatly change the basic texture.
• Lean doughs contain only relatively small amounts of sugar and fat, if any.
Breads made from lean dough tend to have a chewier texture, more bite, and
a crisp crust. Hard rolls, French and Italian-­style breads, and whole wheat,
rye, and pumpernickel breads are considered lean.
• The ingredients are added in a different order depending on the type of
yeast used. If instant dry yeast is used, the yeast should first be blended
with the flour, then all the remaining ingredients should be added to the
flour-­yeast mixture. If active dry or compressed fresh yeast is used, the yeast
should first be blended with the water and allowed to fully dissolve. Next the
flour should be added and all the remaining ingredients should be placed on
top of the flour.
• Wheat flour (all-­purpose or bread flour, for instance) is the basis of yeast-­
raised doughs. Wheat flours contain a high percentage of protein, which gives
a good texture to lean doughs. A portion of the wheat flour called for in a
recipe may be replaced with other flours such as rye, pumpernickel, or oat.

812 | BAKING AND PASTRY

• Bring the yeast to room temperature if necessary before preparing the
dough. Water, milk, or other liquids used in a bread formula should fall within
a temperature range of 68° to 76°F/20° to 24°C for compressed (fresh)
yeast. The ideal water temperature for instant dry yeast is 105° to
110°F/41° to 43°C.
• Salt develops flavor in bread and also helps to control the action of the

development shows a clear difference in development of gluten structure.

9 Cool the baked bread.

Individual recipes will tell you the level of development required.
Dough that has reached short development will become a
homogeneous mass but will fall apart when worked with your hands.
Dough that has reached the improved gluten development stage holds
together but tears when you check for gluten window. Dough that has
reached the intense stage of gluten development will not tear as it is
stretched; it will hold a thin membrane you can see through.
If you overmix the dough, the gluten will break down. The dough will
go from being smooth and elastic to wet and sticky. Your bread will fail,
meaning that it won’t rise properly or bake well. On the other hand, if you
don’t mix the dough enough or mix it improperly, you will also wind up with
low volume and poor internal structure. Poorly mixed dough may mean
that the flour will not absorb the liquids properly and that the dough turns
out irregular. It will have a poor gluten structure and lack elasticity, and the
dough will remain wet and sticky.

3

The properly mixed dough is transferred to a lightly oiled bowl or tub
(stiff or firm doughs can be placed on a lightly floured tabletop) for bulk
fermentation. This is especially important as this is the only time to
develop flavor through fermentation.
Let the dough rest at room temperature until it has doubled in size.
The times suggested in our formulas are based on fermentation at room
temperature (75°F/24°C).
The dough may also be retarded during bulk fermentation. Retarding
dough means to purposely cool the dough, typically at temperatures of
around 40°F/4°C, in order to slow the fermentation process. Retarding
permits bakers to organize their work to meet production and employee
schedules. It also allows the gluten to relax further, since the fermentation
is prolonged. Keeping the dough at cooler temperatures will result in a
longer fermentation period and thus more flavor development.

814 | BAKING AND PASTRY

4

Fold over the dough during or after bulk fermentation to redistribute the available
food supply for the yeast, equalize the temperature of the dough, expel the built-­up
fermentation gases, and to further develop the gluten in the dough. Fold over the dough
and punch it down carefully to preserve the structure already developed.

5

Accurate scaling creates uniformity of size for each dough piece, which allows for
uniformity in proofing and baking times. After scaling, gently preshape the dough into a
round or oblong. Preshaping gives the dough a smooth, tight skin that will help trap the
gases that develop during fermentation.
Resting the dough for 10 to 20 minutes after preshaping, covered with a linen cloth
or plastic wrap, allows the gluten to relax so that the dough will be easier to manipulate
into its final shape.

6

After resting, give the dough its final shape. Brush the dough with egg wash and apply
garnish, if using, after it is shaped, so that the dough is evenly coated
without risk of deflating it after its final rise.

7

After shaping, the dough undergoes one more fermentation. Some doughs, such as the
lean dough used to prepare boules, can simply be placed on a worktable or a board that
has been dusted with flour or cornmeal. Other doughs or shapes may be placed on a
linen cloth (couche), on sheet pans, in loaf pans, in baskets (bannetons), or in wooden
or other molds. During this final rise, it is again important to ensure that a skin does not
form on the surface of the dough. If you are not using a proof box for this final proof, the
dough should be covered. Using the temperature and humidity controls in a proof box
will prevent this from happening without the need to cover the dough.
Lean doughs should be baked in a hot oven (400° to 450°F/204° to 232°C) with
steam; enriched doughs should be baked at a slightly lower temperature (approximately
375°F/191°C). Beyond this, other things that may affect the specific baking temperature
are the type of oven, the size and shape of the product, the desired crust and color
development (or other such characteristics), and the length of the pan proofing.
Once the loaves are baked, it is important that they be cooled properly to preserve the
crust and structure of the bread as well as to allow for final development of flavor. All
breads, but most importantly those made with lean doughs, should be cooled on wire
racks to maintain air circulation around the entire loaf. This will prevent moisture from
collecting on the bread as it cools.

CUSTARDS, CREAMS, AND MOUSSES
When stirred together over gentle heat, eggs, milk, and sugar result in a smooth custard
sauce. When baked, these same ingredients become a smooth and creamy baked custard.
Starches or gelatin can be included to produce textures that range from thick but spoonable
to a sliceable cream. Folding meringue or whipped cream into the custard or cream produces
a cold mousse, Bavarian, or diplomat cream.

818 | BAKING AND PASTRY

Stirred Custards, Creams, and Puddings
Custards prepared on the stovetop, such as vanilla sauce, must be stirred constantly during
cooking until the stage of nappé (coating the back of a spoon). Creams and puddings that are
thickened with starch and cooked on the stovetop must be stirred constantly until they come
to a full boil, both so the starch is heated sufficiently to thicken the mixture and to remove
any undesirable flavor and mouthfeel that uncooked starch contributes.
• Some recipes for stirred custards, creams, and puddings may include whole milk, while
others call for heavy cream, light cream, or a combination of cream and milk. Some recipes
use only egg yolks; others use whole eggs or a blend of whole eggs and egg yolks.
• It is especially important to have all the necessary equipment assembled before
beginning, including a heavy-­bottomed pot or a bain-­marie, a fine-­mesh sieve or conical
sieve, and containers to hold the finished item during cooling and storing. To cool the
custards, creams, or puddings rapidly and safely, have an ice water bath ready.

Continue to cook the sauce over low heat until it begins to thicken, stirring
constantly to prevent it from overcooking. Do not let the sauce come to a
boil, because the egg yolks will coagulate well below the boiling point. The
temperature of the sauce should not go above 180°F/82°C, or it will begin
to curdle.
The sauce is cooked when it has thickened enough to coat the back of
a wooden spoon.

The finished vanilla sauce should coat the back of a wooden spoon
and hold a line drawn through it. When it reaches this stage, strain it
immediately through a fine-­mesh sieve into a container. Cool the sauce in
an ice water bath if it is to be held for later storage or served cold, stirring
frequently as it cools, and refrigerate it immediately. Place a piece of
plastic wrap on the surface to prevent a skin from forming.
A good vanilla sauce is thick and glossy and coats the back of a
wooden spoon. It shows no signs of curdling. This sauce should have a
smooth, luxurious mouthfeel, with a well-­balanced flavor.

BAKED CUSTARDS
A simple baked custard calls for blending eggs, a liquid such as milk or cream, and sugar and
baking until set. Baked custards include crème brûlée and flan. Savory custards eliminate
the sugar.
There are two basic methods for combining the ingredients to make a baked custard: warm
and cold. For the cold method of mixing a custard base, the ingredients are simply stirred
together, then poured into molds and baked. This method is effective for small batches.
To mix a custard base using the warm method, heat the milk or cream and some of the sugar,
stirring with a wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Add the flavorings at
this point and allow them to steep off the heat and covered, if necessary, long enough for
them to impart a rich, full flavor. Blend the eggs and the remaining sugar to make a liaison
and bring the milk or cream to a boil. Whisking constantly, slowly add about one-­third of the
hot milk a few ladlefuls at a time to the liaison, to temper it. Once the liaison is tempered, you
can add the rest of the hot milk more rapidly without scrambling the egg mixture.
Ladle the custard into molds (coat them with a light film of softened butter if you intend
to unmold the custard) and bake them in a hot water bath. The water bath keeps the heat
constant and gentle, resulting in a smooth texture in the baked custard. To check the custard
for doneness, shake the mold gently: When the ripples on the surface move back and forth,
rather than in concentric rings, the custard is properly baked.
Carefully remove the molds from the water bath and wipe the molds dry. Place them on
a cool sheet pan, allow them to cool, and then refrigerate them. For crème caramel, an
overnight resting period (optimally 24 hours) is essential, not only to completely set the
custard so it can be unmolded but also to allow the caramel to liquefy into a sauce.

MOUSSE
The name for this delicate dessert comes from the French; the word translates literally as
“frothy, foamy, or light.” To make a mousse, an aerating ingredient such as whipped cream
and/or meringue is folded into a base, such as a fruit purée, vanilla sauce, cream, pudding,
curd, sabayon, or pâte à bombe (cooked whipped egg yolks). The base should be light and
smooth so the aerating ingredient can be incorporated easily.
• To make an egg-­safe mousse, use pasteurized egg whites or a Swiss or Italian meringue
(see page 775).
• Stabilizers such as gelatin may be used in varying amounts, depending on the desired
result. If a mousse is stabilized with gelatin, it will begin to set immediately, so prepare all
molds and serving containers before beginning preparation.
• It is important to flavor the base well. The base of the mousse provides all of the flavor.
Once the aerators are added, the flavor of the base will become diluted, so make sure the
base is very flavorful to ensure the amount of flavor you desire is carried to the finished
mousse.
• Whatever the flavoring ingredient used, it should be at room temperature and liquid
enough to fold together with whipped cream and/or egg whites without deflating those

822 | BAKING AND PASTRY

foams. To prepare chocolate, chop it into small pieces and melt it over simmering water or
in the microwave. Let it cool to room temperature, at which point it should still be pourable.
• Eggs, both yolks and whites, are called for in some mousse recipes. Consult the recipe
and prepare the eggs as directed. Separate yolks and whites carefully, keeping whites
free of all traces of yolk. Whites generally whip to a greater volume if they are at room
temperature. Use a very clean bowl and wire whip or whisk to beat egg whites.
• Cream should be kept very cold and whipped just to soft peaks. Keep whipped cream very
cold if it is prepared in advance. For the best volume in the whipped cream, chill the bowl
and wire whip or whisk before whipping the cream.
• To maintain its structure during and after whipping, keep the cream cold. Whip the
cream only to soft peaks. After whipping, the cream will be folded into the remaining
ingredients for the mousse. If it is whipped beyond soft peaks, this folding will overwhip the
cream.
• Use a rubber spatula, or similar tool with a broad surface for folding. This will help retain
the volume in the aerators. Lightening the base with a portion of the aerator before folding
quickly as well as gently will also help to retain volume.
• To ensure the lightest mousse, it is also imperative that the containers or pastries that
will hold the mousse are ready before you begin the preparation of the mousse. As soon as
all the ingredients are fully combined, pipe, spread, or pour the mousse into the prepared
containers.

the flavorings be liquid enough to blend easily. Fold in the flavorings until
there are no streaks in the mixture.

5 Carefully fold the remaining egg whites
into the yolk mixture.

Whip the egg whites with the remaining sugar to stiff peaks in a
completely clean and dry bowl. Beat the whites at medium speed at first to
begin to separate the protein strands. Add the sugar in small increments
with the mixer on high speed until the peaks of the beaten whites remain
stiff and do not droop when the beater is pulled from the bowl. The whites
should still appear shiny, not dry. Fold them into the yolk mixture gently to
keep the maximum volume. Some chefs like to add the whites to the yolks
in two or more additions so that the first addition lightens the base. That
way, less volume is lost from subsequent additions.
Use a lifting and folding motion to avoid deflating the mousse. The
finished mousse should be well blended but still retain as much volume
as possible. At this point, the mousse is ready for service or may be
refrigerated, covered, for a short period of time before service. The mousse
may be scooped or piped into molds or containers for presentation.

2

Evaluate the finished mousse. A well-­made mousse should have an intense,
identifiable flavor, with added smoothness and richness from the cream.
The color should be even throughout each portion. Mousses have a light,
foamy texture due to the addition of both beaten egg whites and whipped
cream. When the whites and cream are beaten properly, the texture is very
smooth and fine.

1

Place the flours, butter, water, and salt into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook.

2

Mix on low speed until a smooth dough forms, about 3 minutes.

3

Shape the dough into a rough rectangle. Transfer it to a sheet pan lined with parchment paper, wrap the dough in
plastic wrap, and allow it to relax in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes.

4

To prepare the roll-­in, blend the butter and flour on low speed with the paddle until smooth, about 2 minutes.
Transfer it to a sheet of parchment paper. Cover with a second sheet and roll into a rectangle 8 by 12 in/20 by 30 cm.
Square off the edges, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm but still pliable. Do not allow the roll-­in to
become cold.

5

To lock the roll-­in into the dough, transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll it into a rectangle 16 by
24 in/41 by 61 cm, keeping the edges straight and the corners square. Set the roll-­in on half of the dough and fold the
remaining half of the dough over the roll-­in. Seal the edges, turn the dough 90 degrees, and roll it into a rectangle 16
by 24 in/41 by 61 cm, making sure the edges are straight and the corners are square.

6

Administer a four-­fold. Cover the dough in plastic wrap and allow it to rest for 30 to 45 minutes in the refrigerator.

7

Turn the dough 90 degrees from its position before it was refrigerated and roll it into a rectangle 16 by 24 in/41 by

Scale the dough into 1-­lb/454-­g pieces. For each loaf, shape the dough into an oblong. (Work sequentially, here and in
later steps, starting with the first piece of dough you divided and rounded.) Let the dough rest, covered, until relaxed,
15 to 20 minutes.

2

Position the dough lengthwise, parallel to the edge of the work surface with the seam side up. Press lightly with your
fingertips to stretch it into a rectangle 10 in/25 cm long, using as little flour as possible. Fold the top edge of the
dough down to the center of the dough, pressing lightly with your fingertips to tighten the dough. Fold the dough
lengthwise in half and use the heel of your hand to seal the two edges together, keeping the seam straight. Roll the
dough under your palms into a cylinder 20 in/51 cm long. Keep the pressure even and hold your hands flat and
parallel to the work surface. Move your hands outward from the center of the cylinder toward the ends and slightly
increase the pressure as you move outward, until both ends have an even, gentle taper. Then increase the pressure at
the ends of the loaf to seal them.

3

Place the loaves seam side down into a pan or onto a parchment-­lined sheet pan. Proof, covered, until the dough
springs back very slowly to the touch, 30 to 45 minutes. (Baguettes should be slightly underproofed when placed

CHAPTER 31

KITCHEN
DESSERTS AND
SAVORY BAKING
Even in teams without dedicated
pastry chefs, guests still crave desserts
and savory baked goods. Kitchen
desserts can be assembled using basic
components for a sweet ending to any
meal.

Kitchen desserts typically refer to desserts that can be easily prepared or
assembled, without the need for complex baking techniques or elaborate
ingredients. Using techniques and ingredients found in previous chapters, any
chef can create an assortment of desirable desserts to entice customers, like
cakes, tarts, and profiteroles, as well as popular desserts, like tiramisu and
crème brûlée.

CAKES
Cake can refer to something as simple as a butter loaf cake and quick breads
or a creation as decadent as a layered chocolate mousse cake for celebrating
special occasions. There are endless variations of fillings and icings to create
cakes that reflect the flavors and ingredients of any menu.
The base cake type should be selected for most desirable flavors and textures.
Cakes that use the creaming method tend to be denser than those made using
the foaming method or a combination.

Cooling and Storing Quick
Breads and Cakes
Quick breads and cakes should be allowed to cool slightly (just enough so they
can be handled) before unmolding. Wire racks are best to use because they
allow air to circulate under the pan, where much heat is retained.
First, gently help the cake or loaf release from the pan. Run a small metal
spatula or knife around the inside edge of the pan, pressing the implement
against the pan to ensure that you do not cut into the cake or loaf. Invert the
pan onto a cardboard cake round or wire cooling rack, gently shake the pan
and tap its bottom. Lift the pan to fully release the baked item. Peel away
the parchment paper from the bottom of the cake or loaf to allow the steam
to escape.
In some cases, icings may be drizzled onto items that are still slightly warm
from the oven, but in most instances cakes should be completely cooled before
cutting, filling, and icing or frosting.
The shelf life for quick breads and cake layers is relatively limited when they are
left exposed to the air. However, they can be frozen for up to three weeks when
tightly wrapped in plastic wrap. Before serving or use, they should be allowed to
Fruit curd is a smooth custard made
from fruit juice, zest, sugar, eggs, and
butter. It has a rich and creamy texture
with a tangy and intense fruit flavor. Fruit

thaw at room temperature.

Fillings

curds are commonly made with citrus

Fillings for cakes may complement or contrast with the flavor of the cake. For

fruits such as lemons, limes, oranges, or

example, a chocolate cake could be filled with either a chocolate or a raspberry

other tart fruits like passion fruit, berries,

filling. The chocolate filling would make a richer cake, while the raspberry

or even mango. Curds are prepared like
other stovetop custards (see page 819).

846 | BAKING AND PASTRY

filling, with its fresh berry flavor and acidity, would cut the richness of the
chocolate cake.

Texture is also important when selecting a filling for a cake. The general rule is that the
texture of the filling should match that of the cake. Lighter aerated fillings should be used
with lighter cakes, such as sponge or chiffon; a mousse filling should never be paired with a
pound cake. Richer fillings such as paddled hard ganache or cream fillings are better choices
for pairing with rich creamed cakes. When filling a cake with a rich, heavy filling, use less than
you would if using a lighter, more delicate filling.
Fillings can be as simple as prepared jams and fruit curds, but many fillings are simple to
prepare and can be made ahead of time, like chocolate ganache (page 771).

Buttercream
Buttercreams are made by blending soft butter into an egg-­and-­sugar base. Buttercreams
help to make elegant cakes and tortes. The manner in which the eggs and sugar are
combined, as well as whether whole eggs, egg yolks, or egg whites are used, produces a
variety of buttercreams.
For all types of buttercream, it is important that the butter be soft and at room temperature;
hard butter will not incorporate to form a creamy smooth frosting. To make Swiss
buttercream, combine the sugar and egg whites and gently whisk over a simmering hot
water bath until the sugar is dissolved, the mixture is warm, and the egg whites are frothy.
Next whip the mixture to form a stiff peak meringue, add the butter, and whip to form the
buttercream. Swiss buttercream is stable and good for icing cakes and piping borders and
décor, but if you want the most stable buttercream, use Italian buttercream.
Flavorings for buttercream must also be at room temperature and ready to add as soon as
the buttercream is made. The following flavorings are for 1 lb/454 g of prepared buttercream:
3 oz/85 g bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled
2 oz/57 g white or milk chocolate, melted and cooled
2 oz/57 g praline paste, 1 tbsp/15 mL brandy, and 1 tsp/5 mL vanilla extract

American Buttercream
This is the simplest form of buttercream and is made by creaming together softened butter
with confectioners’ sugar and flavorings, without the use of eggs. It is easy to make and store,
and it is often used for cupcakes and quick decorations. It is the most stable icing, making it
popular in high-­volume bakeshops.

chapter 31 • KITCHEN DESSERTS AND SAVORY BAKING | 847

Italian Buttercream
Italian buttercream is made with meringue, butter, and flavorings. A meringue-­based
buttercream may be made with Italian or Swiss meringue (see Meringues, page 773). The use
of egg whites in Italian buttercream results in a relatively white-­colored product that is very
light in texture. The light color and texture of a finished Italian buttercream make it a common
choice for wedding cakes or for any pastries requiring white frosting.

Whip egg whites until frothy in a mixer fitted
with the whip attachment on medium speed. (A whip
attachment is used, as it best incorporates air into the

peaks. It is important not to overwhip the meringue, for
a stiff-­peaked meringue is resistant to incorporation
into other ingredients.

Add soft butter gradually, mixing until fully incorporated after each
addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Scraping
down the sides of the bowl ensures a thoroughly mixed, smooth

Swiss Meringue Buttercream
The egg whites in a Swiss meringue buttercream are aerated through whipping
and stabilized by the dissolving sugar, creating a meringue that can be
successfully incorporated into other ingredients. The combination of the fluffy
consistency and the paleness of the Swiss meringue buttercream make it ideal
for use in wedding cakes and any pastries where a white buttercream is desired.

1

Place sugar and egg whites in a stainless-­steel bowl and whisk to combine.
Set the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water and heat, whisking
constantly, to 165°F/74°C. Whisking the sugar and egg whites over heat
creates the Swiss meringue element of the buttercream.

2

Transfer the mixture to a mixer fitted with the whip attachment and whip
on high speed until the meringue is cool.
chapter 31 • KITCHEN DESSERTS AND SAVORY BAKING | 849

Gradually add butter to the meringue while whipping on high speed; the buttercream
should be light and creamy. Blend in vanilla. The element of meringue in the buttercream
creates a product that is light in texture as well as in color.

4

Cover the buttercream with plastic wrap and store under refrigeration.

German Buttercream
German buttercream is a combination of pastry cream, butter, and flavorings. The pastry
cream contributes to the buttercream’s color. Because it is yellow in color, it is unsuitable for
some purposes where a white icing is desired. German buttercream has a richer texture than
meringue-­based buttercreams due to the whole eggs present in the pastry cream.

1

Cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. The mixture of butter and
sugar becomes fluffy due to the incorporation of air into the mixture through the
creaming process.

2

Gradually add pastry cream, mixing after each addition until fully incorporated and
scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.

3

Store covered under refrigeration until ready to use. German buttercream has a notably
short shelf life and is unsuitable for being made in large batches and stored.

French Buttercream
French buttercream is made with either whole eggs or egg yolks, butter, cooked sugar syrup,
and flavorings. It is similar to meringue-­based Italian buttercream in technique, but the egg
yolks make it richer and give it a yellow color.

1

Whip eggs in a mixer fitted with a whip attachment on high speed until light and
fluffy, about 5 minutes. Using egg yolks in addition to whole eggs will make the final
buttercream rich in flavor, as well as give the product a yellow color.

2

Combine sugar and water in a heavy-­bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring
to dissolve the sugar. (A heavy-­bottomed saucepan is used, as it conducts heat most
evenly.) Continue cooking, without stirring, until the mixture reaches 240°F/116°C.

3

Slowly pour the hot sugar syrup into the eggs while whipping on medium speed.
Continue to whip until cool.

4

Gradually add butter, beating after each addition until incorporated and scraping
down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Scraping down the sides of the bowl ensures
a thoroughly mixed, smooth buttercream. When using a mixer that doesn’t touch the
bottom of the bowl, make sure to scrape the bottom as needed.

Flavoring Buttercreams
Many different flavorings are compatible with buttercream. Depending on the intended
use, the amount of flavoring can be reduced or increased. Flavors may also be combined.
It is often practical to make a large batch of buttercream and then flavor small portions as
desired. Flavorings to be added to buttercream ideally should be at room temperature so
they can easily be incorporated.
Buttercreams should be perfectly smooth and soft. They should be sweet but not overly
sweet. There should be no detectable grains or pieces of sugar or any lumps of butter.

CAKE LAYERING AND ICING BASICS
Cake layers should be allowed to cool completely before cutting them into layers. Cakes that
are made of more-­thinner layers are preferable to those with fewer, thicker layers, because
they have a more uniform flavor and texture. Fillings spread onto layers should generally be
less than 1/2 in/1 cm thick.
Before slicing a cake into layers, trim any uneven areas from the sides and top. For the best
results, use a cake-­decorating turntable and a knife with a long, thin, serrated blade. Set the
cake on a cake round and then on the turntable. First, divide the cake by eye into the desired
number of layers. Insert the knife into the side of the cake at the appropriate level and,
holding the knife steady and level and slowing rotating the turntable, move the blade of the
knife into the cake to cut the layer. Remove the layer and set it aside; repeat as necessary.
Before assembling the cake, brush any loose crumbs from the layers.
Cake layers may be moistened with a variety of syrups, from plain simple syrup to one
infused with spices or a liqueur. The syrup adds moisture to drier layers such as sponge
cakes, and adds flavor as well. Brush the syrup evenly over the cut surface of each layer
before it is assembled. The layers should be moistened but not sodden.

the cake after applying the icing, hold a spatula vertically against the cake
at a 45-­degree angle, with the edge of the spatula touching the icing, and
rotate the cake against the spatula; the tip of the spatula should just touch
the surface of the turntable. This will not only smooth the icing, but will
also cause some of the excess icing from the sides to rise above the top of
the cake, making a lip or ridge.

Work from the edges of the cake toward the center. Hold the spatula

3

Mark the cake into portions, if desired, using a straight-­edged knife or long
straight metal spatula. Alternatively, garnish may be applied by treating
the cake top as a whole (this is typically done to smaller cakes or to special
occasion cakes). A variety of simple garnishes can also be applied (such
as a shell border or rosettes), with or without additional garnishes, such as
chocolate cutouts, fresh berries, jam, and the like.

PIES AND TARTS
Pies are an edible container baked in a pan, filled with either savory or sweet fillings, and
sometimes covered with an additional pastry crust or other topping. Pies are served from the
pan in which they were baked and are considered somewhat informal and rustic.
Simply defined, tarts have an open faced, shallow-­bottomed crust, typically sweeter than
pie pastry, filled with either a sweet or savory filling. Tarts are unmolded from their pans
before serving as the sturdier crust allows for easy removal, and are generally more formal in
presentation than pies.
• Fruit fillings are used for many pies and tarts. They are usually prepared with pitted or
sliced and peeled fresh fruit. The fruit is typically combined with sugar and a starch (flour,
arrowroot, cornstarch, or tapioca) to produce a flavorful filling with enough body to slice
into neat portions.
• Cooked cream or pudding fillings should be prepared only after the pie or tart shell has
been completely prepared, baked, and cooled, so that when the filling is ready, it may be
immediately poured into the shell. Hold all fillings at the correct temperature for the best
flavor and consistency in the finished pie or tart.
• A wide variety of toppings are commonly used for pies and tarts, including crumbs or
streusel, pastry crust, meringue, or glazes such as melted chocolate, ganache, or apricot
jam. Egg wash is often applied to double-­crust or lattice-­crust pies or tarts and should be
blended in advance and applied in a thin, even layer with a pastry brush. Pies and tarts
should be baked on sheet pans to catch any drips. Cool pies on wire racks.

Pie Crusts
Traditional pie crust is made using the rubbed-­dough method (see page 792). Flour, butter,
salt, and water come together to form a flaky crust for holding a variety of fillings. Once the
dough is prepared, it must be rolled using a rolling pin to line the pie or tart pan.
To line a pie or tart pan:

854 | BAKING AND PASTRY

chapter 31 • KITCHEN DESSERTS AND SAVORY BAKING | 855

1

Make sure the dough is chilled before rolling, because if the butter or other fat in the
crust becomes too soft, the dough will be difficult to handle. If necessary, massage the
chilled dough or work it with the rolling pin until it is a malleable consistency.

2

Usually the dough is rolled out directly on a work surface that has been dusted lightly
with flour. Bread flour is the best choice for dusting. Because it is lower in starch and
has a slightly more granular texture than other types of flour, bread flour dusts a surface
more evenly with less clumping. Occasionally confectioners’ sugar is used for dusting
the work surface, typically for doughs with a higher sugar content. Dust the work surface
very lightly, thus preserving the dough’s delicate texture and crumb, to ensure that very
little additional flour or sugar is incorporated into it, and to avoid clumps of flour that can
become embedded and baked into it. Lightly dust the dough as well, to prevent it from
sticking to the rolling pin.

3

Roll the dough from the center out. Lift and turn the dough as you roll so that you are
rolling in all directions. This will keep the dough of even thickness and shape. Lifting
and turning the dough will also help to keep it from sticking to the work surface and will
reduce the amount of dusting necessary. To lift larger or more delicate pieces of dough,
lay the dough over the rolling pin to keep it from tearing.

4

Work quickly and carefully. Dough for pies and tarts should be rolled to a thickness of
1/8 in/0.3 cm. Rolling out the dough slowly will allow the fat to become too soft and make
it more likely to tear. Particularly delicate or tender doughs may have to be refrigerated
intermittently during rolling to prevent that from occurring. This added step is often
necessary when making a lattice top, which requires extra handling of the dough. If the
dough tears while you are rolling it, simply patch the tear with a small scrap of dough
and roll over it so that it becomes incorporated. If the dough is too thick, it may not bake
through, and too much dough can overwhelm the flavors of the filling.

5

To transfer the rolled dough to the pie or tart pan, carefully roll it around the rolling pin,
then gently unroll it over the pan. Gently press the dough into the pan, being careful
not to tear or stretch the dough. Trim the edge of the dough so that it fits perfectly into
the pan. Dock the bottom of the crust when necessary to prevent it from bubbling up.
Docking is done by piercing the bottom of a crust in order to allow steam to escape
during baking; the escape of steam through the holes in the crust helps to keep the
dough flat and even.

Forming Crumb Crusts
Many pies feature crusts made from a mixture of ground cookies, nuts, or crackers combined
with a fat, usually melted butter. Sometimes egg whites are added to help the crust hold
together, and sugar and spices can be added for sweetness and flavor. These crusts can be
either unbaked or baked, but baking lends flavor, holds the crust together, and creates a
crunchy, crispy texture.
These crusts are often used in combination with moist and creamy fillings as they do
not readily absorb liquid and remain crisp and crunchy during refrigeration. To make a
crumb crust, pulse the nuts, cookies, or crackers (with sugar or spices, if desired) in a food
processor until finely ground. Transfer the crumb mixture to a bowl and work in the melted
fat, stirring to combine and coat the crumbs.

856 | BAKING AND PASTRY

Press the crumb mixture evenly over the bottom and up the sides of a lightly buttered (or
sprayed) baking pan. If baking the crumb crust, first refrigerate it for 10 to 15 minutes. This
will help the butter resolidify and prevent the crust from shifting during baking.
A basic recipe for a crumb crust is as follows:
1 lb 8 oz/680 g graham cracker or other crumbs
4 oz/113 g sugar
6 oz/170 g butter, melted

1

Mix the ingredients together until fully combined. Then scale the crust into prepared
pans and press into an even layer about 1/4 in/6 mm thick.

2

Crumb crusts should be baked at 350°F/177°C until set and light golden brown, about
7 minutes. Cool the crust completely before filling.

3

For pudding and cream pies, the filling is cooked, then poured into the cooled baked
crust, and refrigerated until set. For cheesecakes, the batter is poured into the cooled
baked crust and then baked until set.

Blind Baking Pie and Tart Shells
To blind bake means to bake an unfilled pie or tart shell partially or fully before adding
the filling.

1

Line the dough with parchment paper and fill with pie weights, dried beans, or rice.
The weights will prevent the bottom of the crust from bubbling up and the sides from
collapsing or sliding down the sides of the pan during baking.

2

Place the pan in the preheated oven. The parchment and weights need only stay in the
pan until the crust feels dry to the touch and begins to take on a golden-­brown color.

3

Once the crust has baked long enough so that it has set and will maintain its form
(generally 10 to 12 minutes), remove the parchment and weights to allow for
even browning.

4

Return the pan to the oven and bake the crust until the desired color is achieved. If the
crust is to be baked again with a filling, bake it just until light golden brown. For a fully
baked crust, bake to a deep golden brown, about 20 minutes. Pastry shells are partially
prebaked when the time required to bake the filling will not be long enough to fully bake
the crust. Shells are completely prebaked when they are to be filled with a filling that
does not require further cooking or baking.

5

Brush prebaked pastry shells with a light coating of softened butter or melted
chocolate and allow to set fully before filling. This will prevent moisture in the filling from
seeping into the crust and making it soggy. Apply the thin coating to the shell using a
pastry brush.

6

Place the shell in the refrigerator so that the butter or chocolate will harden, then fill
the shell.

Pie Fillings
A wide variety of methods and techniques are utilized when making the fillings for pies and
tarts, including fruit fillings, custards, and pastry creams and similar cooked fillings.
chapter 31 • KITCHEN DESSERTS AND SAVORY BAKING | 857

Fruit Fillings
The best fruit pies and tarts are made with fresh fruits at their peak of ripeness, and should
be prepared on the same day as baking.
Fruit pies require a starch to thicken the fruit filling, which can either be precooked on the
stovetop prior to baking, or baked in the oven. Precooking the fruit softens it, releases juices,
evaporates moisture, and allows the filling to thicken, all of which help prevent a soggy
bottom crust and a filling that does not properly set. Berries and cherries benefit from
precooking; apples, apricots, pears, and peaches do not require precooking, as their juices
will readily evaporate. However, the moisture content in fresh produce can vary, making it
sometimes difficult to get the balance of fruit and thickener just right.

Custards
Baked custards and boiled cream pie fillings are two types of custard fillings for pies
and tarts. They are not complicated, generally consisting of pantry ingredients (eggs,
milk or cream, sugar, and sometimes starch) that most home bakers have on hand; yet,
understanding the proper methods of incorporating these key ingredients is vital to
producing a pie or tart with a crisp bottom and a smooth, creamy filling.

Baked custards, such as pumpkin pie, have no added starch and are instead thickened only
with eggs—­either whole eggs or yolks—­for a richer filling. Baked custards can be prepared
either cold or warm, as described in Custards, Creams, and Mousses (page 819), and can be
mixed with sweet or savory ingredients.
Cream pie and tart fillings differ from baked custard fillings in that they are thickened with a
starch on the stovetop, and then poured into a prebaked crust or shell. Often cream pies are
referred to as “icebox” or “refrigerator” pies, as they are chilled to help to set the filling. This
results in neat, clean slices.
Quiche is a savory custard baked in a pie shell, and may include a variety of savory, aromatic,
and other ingredients. Of French origin, this savory pie is often accompanied by herbs
incorporated into the custard, or enhanced with cheese or other appropriate products.
Quiche is often served as a brunch or buffet item, and can be readily portion-­cut and served
with complementary meat or vegetable items.

858 | BAKING AND PASTRY

Topping Pies and Tarts
The treatment of the top of a pie or tart makes it more interesting and appealing. Typically,
toppings of dough or crumb for pies and tarts are used with fruit fillings. Topping a pie
or tart helps to prevent the filling from drying during baking by keeping in moisture. Too
much moisture, however, can be a bad thing. To prevent excessive moisture buildup and/or
retention, cut steam vents into the top of a double-­crust pie to allow steam to escape during
baking. This will also allow the top crust to develop a crisp, flaky texture.
Crumb toppings create less of a moisture barrier, allowing for the release of steam during
baking, and therefore do not require vents. Crumb toppings are quick and easy and add a
different flavor and texture from crusts made of pastry dough. A pastry top may completely
cover the pie or tart or may be cut into strips and woven to create a lattice pattern. Pastry
doughs may also be rolled and cut into shapes used to adorn the top or edges of a pie or tart.
Crimping the edges of a pie is another way to add a decorative element, and for double-­
crusted pies and tarts, it also serves to seal in the filling and seal the top and bottom
crusts together.
Many bakers and pastry chefs apply a wash to the top and edges of their pies and tarts to
promote the development of a golden brown crust. The wash may be anything from milk or
cream to egg wash. For additional sweetness and texture, add a sprinkling of coarse sugar
after applying the wash. If you choose to use a wash, use a pastry brush to apply it in a thin,
even coat. Some like to apply two coats before baking to promote better shine and browning;
apply the first coat of the wash, allow it to dry for 3 to 5 minutes, and then apply the final coat.

COOKIES
Cookies are prepared in many different ways: piped, scooped, sliced, and molded, to
name just a few. They are often served at receptions, as part of a dessert buffet, or with ice
cream or sorbet. An assortment of cookies might be presented at the end of a meal as an
appealing extra.
Cookies contain a high percentage of sugar, so the oven temperature must be carefully
regulated during baking. Convection ovens, which produce evenly baked items, are especially
good for baking many kinds of cookies.
Cookie doughs and batters can be prepared using different mixing methods. Some must
be shaped and baked as soon as the batter or dough is prepared. Others need to be chilled
before they are shaped. Prepare the dough or batter as directed in the recipe and assemble
the tools needed to shape and bake the cookies.

Drop Cookies
Drop cookies typically spread as they bake, so allow enough room for them to expand without
touching each other. Arrange the cookies in even rows for even baking. Bake drop cookies at
325° to 350°F/163° to 177°C until the bottoms are golden brown and the cookies are baked
through but still moist. Cool on wire racks and store in tightly wrapped containers at room
temperature, or freeze for longer storage.

chapter 31 • KITCHEN DESSERTS AND SAVORY BAKING | 859

Rolled and Cut Cookies
Rolled and cut cookies are made from stiff doughs that are often allowed to chill thoroughly
before rolling. While the dough chills, line sheet pans with parchment paper. Roll out the
dough on a lightly floured work surface, using the same technique as described for rolling pie
dough (see Pie Crusts, page 854).
Lightly dust the rolling pin as you work. For some cookies, the work surface and rolling pin
can be dusted with confectioners’ sugar. Very rich and delicate cookie doughs can be rolled
out between two sheets of parchment. When you have finished rolling, the dough should be
even and generally no more than 1/8 to 1/6 in/3 to 4 mm thick. Be sure that the dough is not
sticking to the work surface as you roll it out.
Cutters of various shapes and sizes can be used, or you can cut the dough into shapes with a
knife. As you work, dip the cutter or knife blade into a small amount of flour or confectioners’
sugar to keep it from sticking to the dough.
Transfer the cookies to the sheet pan and bake in a 350°F/177°C oven until the edges of
the cookies just start to turn golden. Immediately transfer them to a wire cooling rack to
prevent overcooking them. Store these cookies well wrapped or in airtight containers at room
temperature.
Shaped cookies are often glazed or iced. These coatings should be applied after the cookie
is completely cool. If the cookies are to be frozen for longer storage, freeze them plain and
decorate or ice them after they have thawed.

Twice-­Baked Cookies
Biscotti or twice-­baked cookies are a type of molded and sliced cookie. They are made into
a half-­moon–shaped log formed directly on lined sheet pans. Once baked, the biscotti are
sliced to make individual cookies. They are returned to the oven on parchment-­lined sheet
pans to lightly toast and dry.

Piped Cookies
Piped cookies are shaped as soon as the dough is completed, so you should assemble all
your equipment before starting to mix the batter. Pastry bags and tips should be assembled
and the sheet pans should be greased or lined with parchment. As soon as the dough is
properly mixed, transfer it to the pastry bag with a rubber spatula and twist the top of the bag
to express any air pockets. Squeeze the pastry bag to form a cookie and release the pressure
on the bag once it is the desired size. Arrange the cookies in neat, even rows and leave some
room for the cookies to spread as they bake.

Stenciled cookies are made from a very soft batter. The batter can be
prepared and held while you assemble the tools for shaping and baking.
Stencils made of heavy flexible plastic can be purchased, or you can cut
them from sturdy cardboard. Line sheet pans with silicone baking mats or
use an inverted sheet pan that has been greased, floured, and then frozen.
Freezing the pan helps the grease and flour stick to the pan rather than
coming off on the cookie as it is stenciled.
Lay the stencil on the prepared sheet pan and drop a spoonful of
batter into the stencil. Spread it into an even layer with a small offset
spatula or the back of a spoon.

2

Remove the stencil and repeat until the sheet is filled. These cookies do
not spread, but be sure to allow enough room so that the stencil will not
disturb any cookies already shaped. Bake carefully, keeping a close eye on
the cookies.

3

Quickly press the hot cookies into a concave mold or over a rolling pin to
shape them into tuiles. Alternatively, shape the tuiles over glass or a PVC
pipe to make them into cups. Tuiles may be used to hold a scoop of ice
cream, mousse, or as a decorative garnish.

862 | BAKING AND PASTRY

Making Ice Cream from Vanilla Sauce
Vanilla sauce, a stirred cooked custard (see Custards, page 819), can be churned and frozen
to become vanilla ice cream. The base can be infused with flavors, like coffee or fruits, or
mixed with inclusions like crushed toffee or chocolate sauce.
All of the ingredients add flavor to the ice cream, but each one also plays a part in
determining consistency and mouthfeel. The eggs make it rich and smooth. For best results,
use a mixture of milk and cream to avoid having too much butterfat in the mix. The milk
and cream allow for incorporation of air during freezing, giving the final product a smoother
mouthfeel and lighter body. However, too much incorporated air will diminish the flavor, make
the ice cream too soft, and make it melt quickly. Sugar both adds sweetness and lowers the
freezing point of the base, keeping the ice cream from freezing too hard.
There are a number of different methods for adding flavorings to ice creams. You may simply
infuse the sauce with flavor while you are making it. Purées can be blended into the custard
after it has cooled, or folded into still soft, just-­churned ice cream for a swirled effect. Melted
chocolate can be added to the still warm, just-­cooked ice cream base, while nut pastes such
as peanut butter and praline paste can be added to the milk and cream and cooked into the
base mixture.
Some fruit juices or frozen concentrates such as lemon, orange, or passion fruit have very
intense flavor. Add up to 8 fl oz/240 mL of these juices or frozen concentrates to the same
amount of the base as you would purée, using just enough to give the proper flavor. It is not
necessary to reduce the volume of liquid in the base; adding this amount of additional liquid
to a 1 1/2-­qt/1.44-­L batch will not noticeably affect the ice cream’s texture or volume.
The ice cream base should be allowed to mature in the refrigerator at approximately
40°F/4°C for several hours before freezing. This will result in a smoother ice cream.
To churn the ice cream, run the chilled base in an ice cream freezer only to soft-­serve
consistency. Extract it from the machine, pack into containers, and place in a freezer for
several hours to allow it to firm to a servable temperature and consistency.

SAUCES
The proper sauce is essential for a successful dessert presentation. Always serve a sauce
that will complement or enhance—­not overwhelm—­the textures and flavors of the dessert.
You may want to avoid serving a dessert with a sauce of the same consistency and texture;
for example, do not serve creamy Vanilla Sauce (page 838) with ice cream. Instead, use a fruit
coulis or another sauce that will provide contrast.
By adding or substituting ingredients, you can adapt these sauces to suit any type of
dessert item.

chapter 31 • KITCHEN DESSERTS AND SAVORY BAKING | 863

Chocolate Sauce
The success of any chocolate sauce depends primarily on the quality of the chocolate. Use
the best quality chocolate available to ensure a smooth, richly flavored sauce. Dark chocolate
sauces can be made from unsweetened or bittersweet chocolate or a combination of the
two. To get the most intense flavor, add a measure of cocoa powder, but be sure to adjust the
sauce’s flavor and sweetness with sugar.

1

Combine sugar, water, and corn syrup in a heavy-­bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil
over medium-­high heat. Remove from the heat.

2

Place cocoa powder in a bowl and add enough of the hot sugar syrup to make a paste,
stirring until smooth.

3

Gradually add the remaining syrup and mix until fully incorporated. Adding the syrup
slowly ensures that the final mixture is fully hydrated and evenly incorporated.

4

Add melted chocolate and blend until fully incorporated. The chocolate must be melted
carefully to prevent it from scorching or becoming grainy.

5

Strain the sauce through a fine-­mesh sieve.

6

Serve warm or chilled.

Fruit Sauces
There are two basic categories of fruit sauces: coulis, which is a smooth puréed mixture
made using either fresh or frozen fruit; and compote, which is a chunky mixture made using
dried, fresh, or frozen fruit. Both types of sauce may be cooked or uncooked. However,
coulis are typically cooked or heated only slightly to facilitate the full incorporation of sugar.
Compotes, on the other hand, may be simmered for a period of time to infuse flavors, soften
dried fruits, or reduce liquids.
Fruit sauces may be used as a base for flourless soufflés or to flavor Bavarian cream,
buttercream, and other fillings and frostings.

1

For a basic coulis, combine fruit, sugar, and lemon juice in a saucepan and heat over
medium heat.

2

Simmer, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved, about 10 minutes.

3

Strain the coulis through a fine-­mesh sieve. Straining ensures that the final coulis will be
as smooth as possible, free of any seeds or other unwanted fruit product.

4

Add sugar or lemon juice to taste, if necessary.

SAVORY BAKING
The essential element of savory baking is the ability to adapt already-­developed traditional
cooking skills to the novel and nontraditional aspects of savory baking.

Shaping Lean Dough
A basic lean dough can be combined with flavoring ingredients like herbs, spices, cheese,
or caramelized onions to create rolls or sliceable breads. Use the technique for mixing lean
doughs at page 812 to prepare rounds or loaves, depending on how they will be used.
For large rounds (from 6 oz to 4 1/2 lb/170 g to 2.04 kg):

1

Position the dough so one long edge is parallel to the edge of the work surface.

2

Fold the top edge of the dough down to the bottom edge. Using the heel of your hand,
seal the two edges together. Rotate the dough 90 degrees.

3

Fold the top edge of the dough down to the bottom edge. Using the heel of your hand,
seal the two edges together. Place the seam on the bottom.

4

Cup both hands around the dough and pull it toward you, giving it a one-­quarter turn;
continue until fully tightened.

For small rounds (from 2 to 6 oz/60 to 170 g):

1

Position the dough so one long edge is parallel to the edge of the work surface.

2

Fold the top edge of the dough down to the bottom edge. Using the heel of your hand,
seal the two edges together. Rotate the dough 90 degrees.

3

Fold the top edge of the dough down to the bottom edge. Using the heel of your hand,
seal the two edges together.

4

Place your hand over the ball of dough and curl your fingers so that the first knuckles of
your fingers are touching the table. Your fingertips should almost be touching the palm
of your hand, and your thumb should be out to the side and touching the table; the
heel of your hand should also be touching the table. The dough should be sitting near
the top of your palm, near your thumb, forefinger, and middle finger.

5

Using your palm, push the dough away from you in an arc to the right. Using your
fingertips, pull the dough toward you in an arc to the left. Repeat this circular motion,
applying gentle pressure while rounding the dough, to create a tight, smooth ball.

For large oblongs (from 12 oz to 1 3/4 lb/340 to 790 g)

1

Position the dough so one long edge is parallel to the edge of the work surface.

2

Stretch the dough into a rectangle 10 in/25 cm long. Fold the left and right edges of the
rectangle into the center of the dough, pressing the dough lightly with your fingertips.

3

Fold the top edge of the dough down to the center of the dough, pressing lightly with
your fingertips. Fold the top of the dough down to the bottom edge. Seal the two edges
together, using the heel of your hand.

4

Roll the dough into an even cylinder 6 in/15 cm long.

Baking Lean Dough
Lean doughs should be baked in a hot oven (440° to 500°F/227° to 260°C) with steam;
enriched doughs should be baked at a lower temperature (350° to 400°F/177° to 204°C).
Beyond this, other factors that may affect the specific baking temperature are the type of
oven, size and shape of the product, and desired crust and color development.
During baking, carbon dioxide and steam are released in the bread and expand to further
leaven the bread. The gluten strands (and eggs, if used) stretch and coagulate to develop the
internal structure of the bread. The starches gelatinize to form the crust, and flavor and color
develop as sugar caramelizes.
Once the loaves are baked, it is important that they be cooled properly in order to preserve the
crust and structure of the bread, as well as to allow for final development of flavor. All breads, but
especially those made with lean doughs, should be cooled on wire racks to maintain air circulation
around the entire loaf. This will prevent moisture from collecting on the bread as it cools.

Pizza
Pizza dough is a simple lean dough—­it’s made of flour, water, salt and yeast. It’s prepared
with the straight dough method (see lean doughs, page 812), though it may be enriched with
olive oil to add richness and shorten the dough—­making it more tender.
After preparing and resting the dough, it is stretched or rolled to a thin flat layer to which
any number of toppings or fillings are added, most often a meat, fish, or poultry item with
complementary vegetables, herbs, and sauce.
Pizzas, like other lean bread doughs, should be baked in a hot oven as quickly as possible.
For this reason, long-­cooking ingredients, like some meats or dense vegetables, should be
precooked before using as toppings.

Other Flatbreads
Flatbreads are one of the oldest and most varied categories of breads. Countries all over
the world have their versions of flatbread, often even varying vastly by region within those
countries. Flatbreads can be made easily, quickly, and with very little equipment. Not all
flatbreads are yeast-­risen, so many have very little or no rising or resting time. Because they
are so thin, flatbreads have a very fast baking time as well. This makes flatbreads easy to
reproduce in a variety of professional kitchens.

866 | BAKING AND PASTRY

Naan, a yeast-­raised flatbread that originated in India, is still baked much the way as the early
flatbreads were baked. That is, naan is baked on the walls of a fire-­heated tandoori oven,
which is made of stone. Today, in many kitchens without access to wood-­fired ovens, it is
cooked on a flat-­top griddle or even an overturned pan.
In many countries, flatbreads serve as a substitute for utensils, used to scoop up foods that
are often served family style. In other countries, flatbreads are eaten much like regular loaves,
topped or filled with spreads or toppings, and eaten like wraps or sandwiches.
There are dozens of unique flatbreads; a few common ones and their variations are:
• Chapati and rotis: Breads of India that are fried in ghee.
• Puri: A fried bread made with whole-­grain flour.
• Papadam: A thin fried flatbread made from lentil flour.
• Pita (Greece), Pitta (Middle East), or Pide (Turkey): A thick, soft flatbread made from a
salted yeast-­leavened dough. Sometimes butter is incorporated. These are used to hold
many items, such as zaziki, gyros, and falafel.
• Lefse: From Norway, a thin and crispy pancake-­like bread.
• Tortilla: Made in Central America, tortillas can be made from corn, whole wheat, or plain
flour. They are most commonly eaten with fillings.

Storing Flatbreads
Many flatbreads have a longer shelf life than typical loaves of bread. Flatbreads with a crisp
texture, like lavash or grissini, will often last as long as one week at room temperature, stored
in an airtight container. Some flatbreads can be refrigerated to lengthen their shelf life—­Pita
(page 883) and tortillas are often refrigerated and then warmed in the oven or in a pan on
the stovetop before serving. Depending on the recipe, they can last in refrigeration up to
three weeks.
Many flatbreads can be frozen without sacrificing quality. Some can be frozen raw
(uncooked), while others are frozen after being fully cooked and are warmed in the oven or on
the stovetop after they are thawed. Frozen flatbreads can keep for up to 3 months.

Savory Scones and Biscuits
Depending on where you are in the world, the words “biscuit” and “scone” can have very
different meanings. In the United States, biscuits and scones are similar: rubbed doughs with
chemical leaveners, gently rolled flat and cut into individual pieces. Baked, they are flaky and
crumbly. Biscuits are typically savory, and scones are generally sweet.
To make biscuits, follow the recipe on page 827, adding garnishes as desired. For savory
scones, which will be slightly denser than the Buttermilk Biscuit recipe, follow these steps
and recommended flavorings:

INTRODUCTION
To become a chef is a process with no clear finish. Cooking, and the culinary industry
as a whole, is ever-changing, as chefs discover new techniques, technologies, and even
ingredients that change the landscape of the industry at a seemingly constant rate. There is
always a new breakthrough just around the corner.
But while so much changes, the core of the kitchen—­how to hold a knife, how to combine
flavors, the precision and care of a well-presented dish—­begins with a fundamental
understanding of ingredients and techniques. It is our hope that this book will function both
as a springboard into future growth and as a reference point to anchor the lessons still to
be learned.
Reorganized and streamlined from previous editions, this text draws directly from the
classrooms of The Culinary Institute of America. Presented in a logical, progressive sequence
based on the curriculum of the first-year Culinary Fundamentals course, this book follows an
educational framework to introduce and reinforce foundational culinary concepts and build
a personal toolbox of techniques, ratios, ingredients, and language. The book also explains
key concepts, like front- and back-of-house roles, large and small equipment, ingredient
purchasing, and standardization of recipes. Even more, it addresses the questions and
challenges faced by real students, offering troubleshooting, tips, and photos that help readers
identify problems before they happen.
Readers may use this book to advance their learning by employing it as a broad, basic text or
as a reference tool to answer specific questions about a particular technique. The techniques
as explained have all been tested in the Institute’s kitchens. Each represents one of many
possible variations. The fact that all variations are not included in this text does not imply
that other methods are incorrect. Experience will teach the student many alternatives and
time-savers. The title of this work should not put it into the rarified category of books to be
used only by those working in restaurant or hotel kitchens. The basic lessons of cooking
are the same whether one prepares food for paying guests or for one’s family and friends.
Therefore, we hope that those who look to cooking for a creative outlet will come to regard it
as a valuable tool.
The recipes were carefully selected to highlight and reinforce the elements that make each
technique distinct from another. In preparing these foundational recipes—­like hollandaise
sauce, roast chicken, or even something as simple as steamed broccoli—­readers will gain
the knowledge and essential muscle memory required in a working kitchen. Once ready,
More to Try recipes will expand on the standard techniques to see how they are often
combined and adapted for unique results. Students will also find a thorough explanation of
essential culinary math, ingredient costing, and food and kitchen safety, preparing them for
both the techniques and recipes that follow, but also for real-world experiences that call on
these important and universal skills.

x | introduction

The world of food is almost incomprehensibly vast, spanning millennia and continents.
This text does not, nor could it ever, address each technique, ingredient, or recipe of any
time or place. For that, every aspiring chef must explore beyond this textbook and collect
experiences. What is offered by this text is a foundation on which to build so that students
may begin to develop a sense of how cooking works.
This new edition of The Professional Chef is a return to basics, supporting aspiring chefs and
students of any level to build a strong foundation for a long culinary journey.

PART 1

THE CULINARY
PROFESSIONAL

CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION
TO THE
PROFESSION
Evolving into a professional culinarian
is a lifelong journey full of learned
details and years of experience. It is
challenging and demanding. Specific
techniques and acquired knowledge
are continually tested and improved
upon. The specialized training
required is intricate and precise.
Deciding where to begin your study
is just as important as the process of
learning.

A sound and thorough education emphasizing the culinary fundamentals is the first step to
becoming fluent in the trade. Aspiring professionals will find formal training at an accredited
school an excellent beginning. Other training alternatives include taking part in special
apprenticeship programs or self-­directed courses of study. The process involves advancing
from kitchen to kitchen by learning at the side of chefs who are involved in the day-­to-­day
business of running a professional kitchen. The goal is to ensure a thorough understanding of
basic and advanced culinary techniques, regardless of the type of training received.
Creating a network of professional colleagues and industry contacts is important for future
development. The avenue of growth that includes working with others, sharing information,
and communicating regularly will help to keep your own work fresh and contemporary.
An established network also makes it much easier for you to find a new position or qualified
employees.
Learning new skills to gain a competitive stance and encourage creativity should be an
ongoing part of your career development. Beneficial and rewarding opportunities result from
attending continuing education classes, workshops, and seminars. Remain up to date with
the following informative resources:
• Magazines and books
• Social media
• Instructional videos
• Government publications

THE KITCHEN BRIGADE SYSTEM
The brigade system was instituted by French chef Auguste Escoffier to streamline and
simplify work in hotel kitchens. It served to eliminate the chaos and duplication of effort
that could result when workers did not have clear-­cut responsibilities. Under this system,
each position has a station and defined responsibilities as outlined below. In smaller
operations, the classic system is generally abbreviated and responsibilities are organized to
make the best use of workspace and talents. A shortage of skilled personnel has also made
modifications in the brigade system necessary.
The chef is responsible for all kitchen operations, including ordering, supervision of all
stations, and development of menu items. He or she also may be known as the chef de
cuisine or executive chef. The sous chef is second in command, answers to the chef, may be
responsible for scheduling, fills in for the chef, and assists the station chefs (or line cooks)
as necessary. Small operations may not have a sous chef. The range of positions in a classic
brigade also include the following:
The sauté chef (saucier) is responsible for all sautéed items and their sauces. This
position is often considered the most demanding, responsible, and glamorous on the line.
The fish chef (poissonier) is responsible for fish items and their sauces, often including
fish butchering. This position is sometimes combined with the saucier position.
The roast chef (rôtisseur) is responsible for all roasted foods and related jus or
other sauces.

4 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

The grill chef (grillardin) is responsible for all grilled foods. This position may be
combined with that of rôtisseur.
The fry chef (friturier) is responsible for all fried foods. This position may be combined
with the rôtisseur position.
The vegetable chef (entremetier) is responsible for hot appetizers and frequently has
responsibility for soups, vegetables, and pastas and other starches. (In a full traditional
brigade system, soups are prepared by the soup station or potager, and vegetables by the
legumier.) This station may also be responsible for egg dishes.
The roundsman (tournant) or swing cook works as needed throughout the kitchen.
The cold-­foods chef (garde manger), also known as the pantry chef, is responsible for
preparation of cold foods including salads, cold appetizers, and pâtés. This is considered
a separate category of kitchen work.
The butcher (boucher) is responsible for butchering meats, poultry, and occasionally fish.
The boucher may also be responsible for breading meat and fish items.
The pastry chef (pâtissier) is responsible for baked items, pastries, and desserts.
The pastry chef frequently supervises a separate kitchen area or a separate shop in
larger operations. This position may be further broken down into the following areas of
specialization:
confiseur (prepares candies and petits fours),
boulanger (prepares unsweetened doughs, as for breads and rolls),
glacier (prepares frozen and cold desserts), and
décorateur (prepares showpieces and special cakes).
The expediter or announcer (aboyeur) accepts orders from the dining room and relays
them to the various station chefs. This individual is the last person to see the plate before
it leaves the kitchen. In some operations, this may be either the chef or the sous chef.
The communard prepares the meal served to staff at some point during the shift (also
called the family meal).
The commis or apprentice works under a station chef to learn how the station operates
and its responsibilities.

THE DINING ROOM BRIGADE
SYSTEM
The dining room, or front-­of-­the-­house, positions also have an established line of authority.
The maître d’hôtel, known in American service as the dining room manager, is the person
who holds the most responsibility for the front-­of-­the-­house operation. The maître d’hôtel
trains all service personnel, oversees wine selection, works with the chef to determine the
menu, and organizes seating throughout service.
The wine steward (chef de vin or sommelier) is responsible for all aspects of restaurant
wine service, including purchasing wines, preparing a wine list, assisting guests in wine
selection, and serving wine properly. The wine steward may also be responsible for
the service of liquors, beers, and other beverages. If there is no wine steward, these
responsibilities are generally assumed by the maître d’hôtel.
chapter 1 • INTRODUCTION TO THE PROFESSION | 5

The head waiter (chef de salle) is generally in charge of the service for an entire dining
room. Very often this position is combined with the position of either captain or
maître d’hôtel.
The captain (chef d’étage) deals most directly with the guests once they are seated.
The captain explains the menu, answers any questions, and takes the order. The captain
generally does any tableside food preparation. If there is no captain, these responsibilities
fall to the front waiter.
The front waiter (chef de rang) ensures that the table is properly set for each course, that
the food is properly delivered to the table, and that the needs of the guests are promptly
and courteously met.
The back waiter or busboy (demi-­chef de rang or commis de rang) is generally the
first position assigned to new dining room workers. This person clears plates between
courses, fills water glasses and bread baskets, and assists the front waiter and/or captain
as needed.

Other Opportunities
In addition to the kitchen and dining room positions, a growing number of less traditional
opportunities exist, many of which do not involve the actual production or service of foods.
Food and beverage managers oversee all food and beverage outlets in hotels and other large
establishments.
Consultants and design specialists will work with restaurant owners, often before the
restaurant is even open, to assist in developing a menu, designing the overall layout and
ambience of the dining room, and establishing work patterns for the kitchen.
Well-­informed salespeople help chefs determine how best to meet their needs for food
and produce, introduce them to new products, and demonstrate the proper use of new
equipment.
Teachers are essential to the great number of cooking schools nationwide. Most of these
teachers are chefs who share the benefit of their experience with students.
Food writers and critics discuss food trends, restaurants, and chefs. It will always mean more,
of course, if the writer is well-versed in the culinary arts. Some prominent members of the
food media, such as James Beard, Julia Child, and Anthony Bourdain have been influential
teachers and have written landmark cookbooks in addition to contributing to newspapers
and magazines and appearing on television.
Food stylists and photographers work with a variety of publications, including magazines,
books, catalogs, and promotional and advertising pieces. Food stylists are also commonly
used in commercial video productions, and may have specialties, like beverages or breads.
Research-­and-­development kitchens employ a great many culinary professionals. These may
be run by food manufacturers who are developing new products or food lines, or by advisory
boards hoping to promote their products. Test kitchens are also run by a variety of both trade
and consumer publications.
Challenges aside, the foodservice industry is rewarding and spontaneous. It requires stamina,
drive, and creative influence. Those who have made the greatest impression know that
6 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

virtues such as open communication, efficient organization, proper management, innovative
marketing, and thorough accounting are necessary to prosper. In due time, your knowledge
and experience will gain worthy recognition.

FOOD AND KITCHEN SAFETY
The importance of food and kitchen safety cannot be overemphasized. Few things are as
detrimental to a foodservice establishment as an officially noted outbreak of a food-­borne
illness caused by poor sanitary practices. In addition to providing a sanitary atmosphere
and adhering to procedures for safe food handling, it is also important to ensure a safe
working environment. This section covers the causes of food-­borne illnesses and prevention
procedures and includes checklists to help the staff achieve sanitary and safe kitchen
conditions.

Food-­Borne Illness
Foods can serve as carriers for many different illnesses. The most common symptoms of
food-­borne illnesses include abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, possibly
accompanied by fever. These symptoms may appear within a few hours after consumption of
the affected food although in some cases several days may elapse before onset. For a food-­
borne illness to be declared an official outbreak, it must involve two or more people who have
eaten the same food, and health officials must confirm it.
Food-­borne illnesses are caused by adulterated foods (foods unfit for human consumption).
The severity of the illness depends on the amount of adulterated food ingested and, to a great
extent, the individual’s susceptibility. Children, older people, and anyone whose immune
system is already under siege generally will have much more difficulty than a healthy adult in
combating a food-­borne illness.
The source of the contamination affecting the food supply can be chemical, physical, or
biological. Insecticides and cleaning compounds are examples of chemical contaminants
that may accidentally find their way into foods. Physical contaminants include bits of glass,
rodent hairs, and paint chips. Careless food handling can mean that even an earring or a
plastic bandage could fall into the food and result in illness or injury.
Biological contaminants account for the majority of food-­borne illnesses. These include
naturally occurring poisons, known as toxins, found in certain wild mushrooms, rhubarb
leaves, green potatoes, and other plants. The predominant biological agents, however, are
disease-­causing microorganisms known as pathogens, which are responsible for up to
95 percent of all food-­borne illnesses. Microorganisms of many kinds are present virtually
everywhere, and most are helpful or harmless, if not essential; only about 1 percent of
microorganisms are actually pathogenic.
Food-­borne illnesses caused by biological contaminants fall into two subcategories:
intoxication and infection. Intoxication occurs when a person consumes food containing
toxins from bacteria, molds, or certain plants and animals. Once in the body, these toxins act
as poison. Botulism is an example of an intoxication.
In the case of an infection, the food eaten by an individual contains large numbers of living
pathogens. These pathogens multiply in the body and generally attack the gastrointestinal
lining. Salmonellosis is an example of an infection. Some food-­borne illnesses have
chapter 1 • INTRODUCTION TO THE PROFESSION | 7

characteristics of both an intoxication and an infection. Escherichia coli is an agent that
causes such an illness.

Food Pathogens
The specific types of pathogens responsible for food-­borne illnesses are fungi, viruses,
parasites, and bacteria. Fungi, which include molds and yeast, are more adaptable than
other microorganisms and have a high tolerance for acidic conditions. They are more often
responsible for food spoilage than for food-­borne illness. Beneficial fungi are important to the
food industry in the production of cheese, bread, wine, and beer.
Viruses do not actually multiply in food, but if through poor sanitation practice a virus
contaminates food, consumption of that food may result in illness. Infectious hepatitis
A, caused by eating shellfish harvested from polluted waters (an illegal practice) or poor
hand-­washing practices after using the restroom, is an example. Once in the body, a virus
invades a cell (called the host cell) and essentially reprograms it to produce more copies
of the virus. The copies leave the dead host cell behind and invade still more cells. The best
defenses against food-­borne viruses are good personal hygiene and obtaining shellfish from
certified waters.
Parasites are pathogens that feed on and take shelter in another organism, called a host.
The host receives no benefit from the parasite and, in fact, suffers harm or even death as a
result. Amebas and various worms such as Trichinella spiralis, which is associated with pork,
are among the parasites that contaminate foods. Different parasites reproduce in different
ways. One example is the parasitic worm that exists in larval stage in muscle meats. Once
consumed, its life cycle and reproductive cycle continue. When the larvae reach adult stage,
the fertilized females release more eggs, which hatch and travel to the muscle tissue of the
host, and the cycle continues.
Bacteria are responsible for a significant percentage of biologically caused food-­borne
illnesses. To better protect food during storage, preparation, and service, it is important
to understand the classifications and patterns of bacterial growth. Among the different
conventions for the classification of bacteria, the most relevant to chefs are their requirement
for oxygen (aerobic/anaerobic/facultative), their effects on people (pathogenic/undesirable/
beneficial/benign), and their spore-­forming abilities. Aerobic bacteria require the presence
of oxygen to grow. Anaerobic bacteria do not require oxygen and may even die when exposed
to it. Facultative bacteria can function with or without oxygen. It is also important to know at
which temperature bacteria grow best. Certain bacteria are able to form endospores, which
serve as a means of protection against adverse circumstances such as high temperature or
dehydration. Endospores allow an individual bacterium to resume its life cycle if favorable
conditions should recur.
Bacteria require three basic conditions for growth and reproduction: a protein source, readily
available moisture, and time. The higher the amount of protein in a food, the greater its
potential as a carrier of a food-­borne illness. The amount of moisture available in a food is
measured on the water activity (Aw) scale. This scale runs from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the
Aw of water. Foods with a water activity above 0.85 support bacterial growth. A food’s relative
acidity or alkalinity is measured on a scale known as pH. A moderate pH—­a value between
4.6 and 10 on a scale that ranges from 1 to 14—­is best for bacterial growth, and most foods

8 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

fall within that range. Adding highly acidic ingredients, such as vinegar or citrus juice, to a
food can lower its pH and extend its shelf life.
Many foods provide the three conditions necessary for bacterial growth and are therefore
considered to be potentially hazardous. Meats, poultry, seafood, tofu, and dairy products
(with the exception of some hard cheeses) are all categorized as potentially hazardous foods.
Foods do not necessarily have to be animal-based to contain protein, however; vegetables
and grains also contain protein. Cooked rice, beans, pasta, and potatoes are therefore
also potentially hazardous foods. There are also other unlikely candidates that are ripe for
bacterial growth such as sliced melons, sprouts, and garlic-­and-­oil mixtures.
Food that contains pathogens in great enough numbers to cause illness may still look and
smell normal. Disease-­causing microorganisms are too small to be seen with the naked
eye, so it is usually impossible to ascertain visually that food is adulterated. Because the
microorganisms—­particularly the bacteria—­that cause food-­borne illness are different from
the ones that cause food to spoil, food may be adulterated and still have no “off” odor.
Although cooking food will destroy many of the microorganisms present, careless food
handling after cooking can reintroduce pathogens that will grow even more quickly without
competition for food and space from the microorganisms that cause spoilage. Although
shortcuts and carelessness do not always result in food-­borne illness, inattention to detail
increases the risk of creating an outbreak that may cause serious illness or even death.
The various kinds of expenses related to an outbreak of food-­borne illness, such as negative
publicity and loss of prestige, are blows from which many restaurants can never recover.

Avoiding Cross Contamination
Many food-­borne illnesses are a result of unsanitary handling procedures in the kitchen.
Cross contamination occurs when disease-­causing elements or harmful substances are
transferred from one contaminated surface to another.
Excellent personal hygiene is one of the best defenses against cross contamination. An
employee who reports for work with a contagious illness or an infected cut on the hand
puts every customer at risk. Anytime the hands come in contact with a possible source of
contamination (the face, hair, eyes, and mouth), they must be thoroughly washed before
continuing any work.
Food is at greatest risk of cross contamination during the preparation stage. Ideally, separate
work areas and cutting boards should be used for raw and cooked foods. Equipment and
cutting boards should always be cleaned and thoroughly sanitized between uses.
All food must be stored carefully to prevent contact between raw and cooked items. Place
drip pans beneath raw foods. Do not handle ready-­to-­eat foods with bare hands. Instead, use
suitable utensils or single-­use food-­handling gloves.

PROPER HAND WASHING
To reduce the chances of cross contamination, wash your hands

wash your hands at the beginning of each shift and each new task;

often and correctly. Hands and forearms should be washed using

after handling raw foods; after going to the bathroom, sneezing,

soap and 110°F/43°C water for no less than 20 seconds. Be sure to

coughing, and so forth; and after handling any nonfood item.

Keeping Foods Out of the Danger Zone
135° F

An important weapon against pathogens is the observance of strict time and temperature
controls. Generally, the disease-­causing microorganisms found in foods, except for E. coli
O157:H7, need to be present in significant quantities in order to make someone ill. Once
pathogens have established themselves in a food source, they will either thrive or be
destroyed, depending upon how long foods are in the danger zone.
There are pathogens that can live at all temperature ranges. For most of those capable of
causing food-­borne illness, the friendliest environment provides temperatures within a
range of 41° to 135°F/5° to 57°C—­the danger zone. Most pathogens either are destroyed
or will not reproduce at temperatures above 135°F/57°C. Storing food at temperatures
below 41°F/5°C will slow or interrupt the cycle of reproduction. (It should also be noted that
intoxicating pathogens may be destroyed during cooking, but any toxins they have produced
are still there.)
When conditions are favorable, bacteria can reproduce at an astonishing rate. Therefore,
controlling the time during which foods remain in the danger zone is critical to the prevention
of food-­borne illness. Foods left in the danger zone for a period longer than 4 hours are
considered adulterated. Additionally, the four-­hour period is cumulative, meaning that the
meter continues running every time the food enters the danger zone. Once the four-­hour
period has been exceeded, heating or cooling cannot recover foods.

Receive and Store Foods Safely
It is not unheard of for foods to be delivered to a foodservice operation already contaminated.
To prevent this from happening to you, inspect all goods to be sure they arrive in sanitary
conditions. Check the ambient temperature inside the delivery truck to see that it is correct.
Check the temperature of the product as well as the expiration dates. Verify that foods have
the required government inspection and certification stamps or tags. Randomly sample
items and reject any goods that do not meet your standards. Move the items immediately
into proper storage conditions.
Refrigeration and freezer units should be maintained on a regular schedule and equipped
with thermometers to ascertain that the temperature remains within a safe range.
Although in most cases chilling will not actually kill pathogens, it does drastically slow down
reproduction. In general, refrigerators should be kept between 36° and 40°F/2° and 4°C, but
quality is better maintained if certain foods can be stored at these specific temperatures:
Meat and poultry: 32° to 36°F/0° to 2°C
Fish and shellfish: 30° to 34°F/−1° to 1°C
Eggs: 38° to 40°F/3° to 4°C

10 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

Dairy products: 36° to 40°F/2° to 4°C
Produce: 40° to 45°F/4° to 7°C
Separate refrigerators for each of the above categories are ideal, but if necessary, a single
unit can be divided into sections. The front of the unit will be the warmest area, the back the
coldest. Before storing food in the refrigerator, it should be properly cooled, stored in clean
containers, wrapped, and labeled clearly with the contents and date. Store raw products
below and away from cooked foods to prevent cross contamination by dripping. Use the
principle of “first in, first out” (FIFO) when arranging food, so that older items are in the front.
Dry storage is used for foods such as canned goods, spices, condiments, cereals, and
staples such as flour and sugar, as well as for some fruits and vegetables that do not require
refrigeration and have low perishability. As with all storage, the area must be clean, with
proper ventilation and air circulation. Cleaning supplies should be stored in a separate place.

Hold Cooked or Ready-­to-­Serve Foods Safely
Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Use hot-­holding equipment (steam tables, double
boilers, bain-­maries, heated cabinets or drawers, chafing dishes, etc.) to keep foods at or
above 135°F/57°C. Do not use hot-­holding equipment for cooking or reheating. Use cold-­
holding equipment (ice or refrigeration) to keep cold foods at or below a temperature
of 41°F/5°C.

Cool Foods Safely
One of the leading causes of food-­borne illness is improperly cooled food. Cooked foods that
are to be stored need to be cooled to below 41°F/5°C as quickly as possible. This should be
completed within 4 hours, unless you use the two-­stage cooling method.
In the first stage of the two-­stage cooling method, foods must be cooled to 70°F/21°C within
2 hours. In the second stage, foods must reach 41°F/5°C or below within an additional
4 hours, for a total cooling time of 6 hours. According to FDA guidelines, using the two-­stage
method quickly moves the food through the part of the danger zone where bacteria grow
most rapidly.
The proper way to cool hot liquids is to place them in a metal container in an ice water bath
that reaches the same level as the liquid inside the container. Stir the liquid in the container
frequently so that the warmer liquid at the center mixes with the cooler liquid at the outer
edges of the container, bringing down the overall temperature more rapidly.
Semisolid and solid foods should be refrigerated in a single layer in shallow containers to
allow greater surface exposure to the cold air. For the same reason, large cuts of meat or
other foods should be cut into smaller portions, cooled to room temperature, and wrapped
before refrigerating.
chapter 1 • INTRODUCTION TO THE PROFESSION | 11

Reheat Foods Safely
When foods are prepared ahead and then reheated, they should move through the danger
zone as rapidly as possible and be reheated to at least 165°F/74°C for a minimum of
15 seconds. If all proper cooling and reheating procedures are followed each time, foods
may be cooled and reheated more than once.
Food should be brought to the proper temperature over direct heat (burner, flattop, grill, or
conventional oven) or in a microwave oven. Do not use hot-­holding equipment for cooking or
reheating. A steam table will adequately hold reheated foods above 135°F/57°C, but it will not
bring foods out of the danger zone quickly enough. Instant-­read thermometers should always
be used to check temperatures.

Thaw Frozen Foods Safely
Frozen foods may be thawed safely in several ways. Never thaw food at room temperature.
The best (though slowest) method is to allow the food to thaw under refrigeration. The food
should still be wrapped and should be placed in a shallow container on a bottom shelf to
prevent possible cross contamination.
If there is no time to thaw foods in the refrigerator, covered or wrapped food may be placed in
a container under running water of approximately 70°F/21°C or below. Use a stream of water
strong enough to circulate the water around the food.
Individual portions that are to be cooked immediately may be thawed in a microwave oven.
Liquids, small items, and individual portions may even be cooked without thawing, but larger
pieces that are cooked while still frozen become overcooked on the outside before they are
thoroughly done throughout.

HAZARD ANALYSIS CRITICAL
CONTROL POINTS (HACCP)
HACCP stands for Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points, which is a scientific state-­of-­the-­
art food safety program originally developed for astronauts. HACCP takes a systematic
approach to the conditions that are responsible for most food-­borne illnesses. It is preventive
in nature, anticipating how food safety problems are most likely to occur and taking steps to
prevent them from occurring. The types of hazards of concern are biological, chemical, and
physical. Biological hazards are typically microbiological, which include bacteria, viruses, and
parasites. Chemical hazards can be found in the sanitation products used in the kitchen, and
physical hazards include glass, wood, stones, or other foreign objects.
The HACCP system has been adopted by both food processors and restaurants, as well as
by the FDA and USDA. At this time, there are no particular mandates that all foodservice
establishments must use HACCP. However, instituting such a plan may prove advantageous
on many levels. The heart of HACCP is contained in the following seven principles:

1

Assess the hazards. The first step in a HACCP program begins with a hazard analysis of
the menu item or recipe. The process must be looked at by designing a flowchart that
covers every step in the period from “dock to dish.”

12 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

2

Identify the critical control points. The next decision to make, after you have established
a flow diagram and identified potential hazards, is to identify the critical control points
(CCPs). A critical control point is the place in the utilization of the food at which you have
the ability to prevent, eliminate, or reduce an existing hazard or to prevent or minimize
the likelihood that a hazard will occur. To quote the 1999 FDA Food Code, a critical
control point is “a point or procedure in a specific food system where loss of control
may result in an unacceptable health risk.” One of the most difficult aspects of putting
together a HACCP program is not to overidentify these critical control points.

3

Establish critical limits and control measures. Critical limits are generally standards
for each critical control point; control measures are what you can do ahead of time
to facilitate the achievement of your critical limit. Many limits have already been
established by local health departments. For example, an established critical limit for the
cooking step in preparing chicken is a final internal temperature of 165°F/74°C. If you
were to hold this chicken on the line before actual service, it would have to be kept at
140°F/60°C to prevent the growth of pathogenic organisms. Holding would be another
critical step in this process.

4

Establish procedures for monitoring CCPs. Critical limits for each CCP have to be
established to identify what is to be monitored. You must also establish how the CCP
will be monitored and who will do it. Monitoring helps improve the system by forcing
identification of problems or faults at particular points in the process. This allows for
more control or improvement in the system.

5

Establish corrective action plans. A plan of action must be identified to deal with a
deviation or substandard level that occurs for a step in the process. Specific corrective
actions must be developed for each CCP, because each food item and its preparation
can vary greatly from one kitchen to the next.

6

Set up a record-­keeping system. Keep documentation on hand to demonstrate whether
the system is working. Recording events at CCPs ensures that critical limits are met
and preventive monitoring is occurring. Documentation typically consists of time/
temperature logs, checklists, and sanitation forms.

7

Develop a verification system. This step establishes procedures to ensure that the
HACCP plan is working correctly. If procedures are not being followed, make the
necessary modifications to the system so that they are.

SERVING FOODS SAFELY
The potential to transmit food-­borne illness does not end when the food leaves the kitchen.
Restaurant servers should also be instructed in good hygiene and safe food-­handling
practices. Hands should be properly washed after using the restroom, eating, smoking, and
touching one’s face or hair, and handling money, dirty dishes, or soiled table linens. When
setting tables, never touch the parts of flatware that come in contact with food, and handle
glassware by the stems or bases only. Carry plates, glasses, and flatware in such a way that
food contact surfaces are not touched. Serve all foods using the proper utensils.

Cleaning and Sanitizing
Cleaning refers to the removal of soil or food particles, whereas sanitizing involves using
moist heat or chemical agents to kill pathogenic microorganisms. For equipment that cannot
chapter 1 • INTRODUCTION TO THE PROFESSION | 13

be immersed in a sink, or for equipment such as knives and cutting boards employed during
food preparation, use a wiping cloth soaked in a double-­strength sanitizing solution to clean
and sanitize between uses. Iodine, chlorine, or quaternary ammonium compounds are all
common sanitizing agents.
Small equipment, tools, pots, and tableware should be run through a ware-­washing machine
or washed manually in a three-­compartment sink. After sanitizing, equipment and tableware
should be allowed to air-­dry completely, because using paper or cloth toweling could result in
cross contamination.

Three-­bay sink used to soak, wash, and sanitize small equipment, tools, pots, and tableware.

Careful sanitation procedures, proper handling of foods, and a well-­maintained facility all
work together to prevent a pest infestation. Take the necessary steps to prohibit the potential
harboring of various pathogens caused by pests.

Food Allergies
The way your body reacts when you eat a food to which you are truly allergic can be dramatic
or even dangerous. An allergic reaction to a food may also occur rapidly. The skin may
become itchy and develop hives or welts. Some people experience swelling of their throats or
tongues. Severe reactions require immediate medical attention.
A true food allergy is nothing to fool around with. As a chef, you can’t assume that a request
for “no garlic” indicates an unevolved palate or an unreasonable food dislike. For the
14 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

individual suffering from a food allergy, even the merest hint of garlic in his or her soup can
set off a reaction.
People who suffer from an allergy will ask about the menu regarding the food(s) that they
cannot eat. It is important that you and your staff know the ingredients used in a dish.
As of January 2006, all packaged foods that contain major food allergens must identify
them on the label, so you must be certain that you have read the label on prepared foods
thoroughly.
It is also important to realize that depending on an individual’s sensitivity, even the very small
amount of allergen left on a piece of equipment and transferred to a food could be enough to
set off a reaction.
Some of the most common food allergies are to the following:
• Peanuts
• Tree nuts (almonds, walnuts, and pecans, plus more)
• Milk
• Eggs
• Wheat
• Soy
• Fish
• Shellfish
• Sesame

KITCHEN SAFETY
In addition to the precautions necessary to guard against food-­borne illness, care must also
be taken to avoid accidents to staff and guests. The following safety measures should be
practiced.

Health and Hygiene
Maintain good general health with regular checkups. Do not handle food when ill. Keep any
burn or break in the skin covered with a clean, waterproof bandage. Cover your face with a
tissue when coughing or sneezing and wash hands afterward.
Keep hair clean, neat, and contained, if necessary. Keep fingernails short and well-maintained,
with no polish. Keep hands away from hair and face when working with food.

Fire Safety
It takes only a few seconds for a simple flare-­up to turn into a full-­scale fire. Grease fires,
electrical fires, or even a waste container full of paper catching fire when a match is carelessly
tossed into it are easy to imagine in any busy kitchen. A comprehensive fire safety plan
should be in place and a standard part of all employee training.
The first step to take to avoid fires is to make sure that the entire staff is fully aware of
potential fire dangers. Be sure that all equipment is up to code. Frayed or exposed wires
chapter 1 • INTRODUCTION TO THE PROFESSION | 15

and faulty plugs can all too easily be the cause of a fire. Overburdened outlets are another
common culprit.
Have fire extinguishers in easily accessible areas. Proper maintenance of extinguishers and
timely inspections by your local fire department are vital. The exits from all areas of the
building should be easy to find, clear of any obstructions, and fully operational.
Thorough training is essential. Everyone should know what to do in case of a fire. Your guests
rely on you and your staff for guidance. Instruct your kitchen staff in the correct way to
handle a grill fire and grease fire. (Above all, make sure everyone knows never to try to put out
a grease, chemical, or electrical fire by throwing water on the flames.) Everyone should know
where the fire department number is posted.

Dressing for Safety
The various parts of the typical chef’s uniform play important roles in keeping workers safe
as they operate in a potentially dangerous environment. The chef’s jacket, for instance, is
double-­breasted to create a two-­layer cloth barrier over the chest to protect against steam
burns, splashes, and spills. (The design also allows the jacket to be rebuttoned on the
opposite side to cover any spills.) The sleeves of the jacket are long to cover as much of the
arm as possible. Pants should be worn without cuffs, which can trap hot liquids and debris.
Be it a tall white toque or a favorite baseball cap, chefs wear hats to contain their hair and
prevent it from falling into the food. Hats also help absorb sweat from overheated brows.
Neckerchiefs serve a similar sweat-­absorbing role.
The apron is worn only to protect the jacket and pants from excessive staining. Side towels
are used to protect their hands when working with hot pans, dishes, or other equipment. Side
towels used to lift hot items must be dry in order to provide protection.
Hard leather shoes with slip-­resistant soles are recommended because of the protection they
offer and the support they give to the feet.
Jackets, pants, aprons, side towels, and shoes can harbor bacteria, molds, and parasites.
Use hot water, a good detergent, and a sanitizer, such as borax or chlorine bleach, to
remove grime.

Regulations, Inspection, and Certification
Federal, state, and local government regulations work to ensure the wholesomeness of the
food that reaches the public. Any new foodservice business should contact the local health
department well in advance of opening to ascertain necessary legal requirements. Some
states and local jurisdictions offer sanitation certification programs. Regulations and testing
vary from area to area. Certification is often available through certain academic institutions.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
OSHA is a federal organization, instituted in 1970, that falls under the purview of the U.S.
Department of Labor. Its regulations help employers and workers establish and maintain a
safe, healthy work environment. Among OSHA’s regulations is the mandate that all places
of employment must have an adequate and easily accessible first-­aid kit on the premises.
In addition, if any organization has more than 10 employees, records must be kept of all
accidents and injuries to employees that require medical treatment. OSHA concentrates its
efforts on providing services where the risk to worker safety is greatest.
16 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
This act is intended to make public places accessible and safe for those with a variety of
disabilities. Any new construction or remodeling done to a restaurant must meet ADA
standards. This includes locating telephones so that a person in a wheelchair can reach them
and providing toilets with handrails.

Drugs and Alcohol in the Workplace
One final topic that is of great importance in the workplace is the right of all workers to be
free from the hazards posed by a coworker who comes to work under the influence of drugs
or alcohol. The abuse of any substance is a serious concern because it can alter or impair
one’s ability to perform his or her job. Reaction times are slowed, inhibitions are lowered, and
judgment is impaired. The responsibilities of a professional working in any kitchen are too
great to allow someone suffering from a substance abuse problem to diminish the respect
and trust you have built with your customers and staff.

CHAPTER 2

MENUS AND
RECIPES
Menus are used in the dining room
to give both wait staff and guests
important information about what
the establishment offers. Recipes
give detailed instructions to aid
kitchen staff in producing menu
items. More than that, carefully
designed menus and comprehensive
recipes can help the professional
chef streamline kitchen operations
and control costs.

MENUS
A menu is a powerful tool. It is a marketing and merchandising vehicle. It establishes and
reinforces the total restaurant concept from the style of china and flatware to staff training
needs. It can assist the chef in organizing the day’s work, ordering food, reducing waste, and
increasing profits. The way a menu is developed or adapted, as well as the way menu prices
are established, is a reflection of how well the operation’s concept or business plan has been
defined. Sometimes the menu evolves as the business plan is refined. In other scenarios, the
concept comes first and the menu comes later. In still others, the menu may be the guiding
principle that gives a particular stamp to the way the restaurant concept evolves.
Menus give the kitchen staff vital information such as whose responsibility it is to prepare
the dish’s components or to plate and garnish it. The preparation of certain garnishes,
side dishes, sauces, or marinades may be organized so that all components of a recipe are
prepared by the chef or cook for that station, or it may be that prep cooks prepare some of
the components.
À la carte and banquet menus call for certain types of advance work to help the chef adjust
to the workflow. Even if a written menu is not provided to the guest, some form of menu list
in the professional kitchen is essential to the kitchen’s smooth operation. Consult the menu,
determine which items you and each staff member are responsible for, and then read the
recipes for those items carefully so that you understand all the tasks that must be performed
in advance of service, as well as at the time of plating and serving the food. In this way,
service should proceed without difficulty.

RECIPES
A recipe is a written record of the ingredients and preparation steps needed to make a
particular dish. The form a recipe takes depends on who will ultimately use the recipe and the
medium in which the recipe will be presented.
Before starting to cook from any recipe, the first step is always to read through the recipe
in its entirety to gain an understanding of exactly what is required. This step will alert you
to any potential surprises the recipe might contain, such as requiring an unusual piece of
equipment or an overnight cooling period. This is also the point at which you must decide
if any modifications to the recipe are in order. Perhaps the recipe makes only 10 portions
and you want to make 50, or vice versa. You will have to convert the recipe (see Using a
Recipe Conversion Factor (RCF) to Convert Recipe Yields, page 23). While increasing or
decreasing the yield, you may discover that you need to make equipment modifications as
well to accommodate the new volume of food. Or you might decide that you want to omit,
add, or substitute an ingredient. All these decisions should be made before any ingredient
preparation or cooking begins.
Once you have read through and evaluated or modified the recipe, it is time to get your mise
en place together. In many recipes, the ingredient list will indicate how the ingredient should
be prepared (e.g., parboiling or cutting into pieces of a certain size) before the actual cooking
or assembling begins.

20 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

Measuring Ingredients Accurately
Accurate measurements are crucial to recipes. In order to keep costs in line and
ensure consistency of quality and quantity, ingredients and portion sizes must
be measured correctly each time a recipe is made.
Ingredients are purchased and used according to one of three measuring
conventions: count, volume, or weight. They may be purchased according to
one system and measured for use in a recipe according to another.
Count is a measurement of whole items as one would purchase them.
The terms each, bunch, and dozen all indicate units of count measure. If
the individual item has been processed, graded, or packaged according
to established standards, count can be a useful, accurate way to measure
ingredients. It is less accurate for ingredients requiring some advance
preparation or without any established standards for purchasing. Garlic cloves
illustrate the point well. If a recipe calls for two garlic cloves, the intensity of
garlic in the dish will change depending upon whether the cloves you use are
large or small.
Volume is a measurement of the space occupied by a solid, liquid, or gas. The
terms teaspoon (tsp), tablespoon (tbsp), fluid ounce (fl oz), cup, pint (pt),

quart (qt), gallon (gal), milliliter (mL), and liter (L) all indicate units of volume
measure. Graduated containers (measuring cups) and utensils for which
the volume is known (such as a 2-ounce ladle or a teaspoon) are used to
measure volume.
Volume measurements are best suited to liquids, though they are also used for
solids, especially spices, in small amounts. Tools used for measuring volume
are not always as precise as necessary, especially if you must often increase
or decrease a recipe. Volume measuring tools don’t conform to any regulated
standards. Therefore, the amount of an ingredient measured with one set of
spoons, cups, or pitchers could be quite different from the amount measured
with another set.
Weight is a measurement of the mass or heaviness of a solid, liquid, or gas.
The terms ounce (oz), pound (lb), gram (g), and kilogram (kg) all indicate units
of weight measure. Scales are used to measure weight, and they must meet
specific standards for accuracy. In professional kitchens, weight is usually the
preferred type of measurement because it is easier to attain accuracy with
weight than it is with volume.

Standardized Recipes

In kitchens, the # symbol is often used as
a shorthand for pounds (or lb/lbs).
The # symbol may also identify the size
of a can. For example, large-volume food
service cans are referred to as #10 cans.
Depending on the ingredient, this can
contain about 6 lb 14 oz/3.18 kg, and
should not be confused with 10 #, or
10 lbs of an ingredient.

The recipes used in each professional kitchen are known as standardized
recipes. Unlike published recipes, standardized recipes are tailored to suit
the needs of an individual kitchen. Preparing well-written and accurate
standardized recipes is a big part of the professional chef’s work in all
foodservice settings, as they include much more than just ingredient names
and preparation steps. Standardized recipes establish total yields, portion
sizes, holding and serving practices, and plating information, and they set

chapter 2 • MENUS AND RECIPES | 21

Be clear and precise when writing recipe ingredients and instructions. For instance: a recipe may call for “1 cup
parsley, minced.” On the left is one cup parsley, ready to be minced; on the right is one cup minced parsley.
Switching the order of the words changes the meaning.

standards for cooking temperatures and times. These standards help to ensure consistent
quality and quantity, permit chefs to monitor the efficiency of their work, and reduce costs by
eliminating waste.
Standardized recipes can be recorded by hand, or electronically using a recipe management
program or other computerized database. They should be recorded in a consistent, clear,
easy-to-follow form and should be readily accessible to all staff members. Instruct kitchen
staff to follow standardized recipes to the letter unless instructed otherwise, and encourage
service staff to refer to standardized recipes when a question arises about ingredients or
preparation methods.
As you prepare a standardized recipe, be as precise and consistent as you can. Include as
many of the following elements as possible:
• Name/title of the food item or dish
• Yield information, expressed as one or more of the following: total weight, total volume, and
total number of portions
• Portion information for each serving, expressed as one or more of the following: a specific
number of items (count), volume, and weight
• Ingredient names, expressed in appropriate detail, specifying variety or brand as
necessary, should be listed in the order used in method
• Ingredient measures, expressed as one or more of the following: count, volume, and weight
• Ingredient preparation instructions, sometimes included in the ingredient name,
sometimes expressed in the method itself as a step

22 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

• Equipment information for preparation, cooking, storing, holding, and serving
• Preparation steps detailing mise en place, cooking methods, and temperatures for safe
food handling (see Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points [HACCP], page 12)
• Service information, describing how to finish and plate a dish and add side dishes, sauces,
and garnishes, if any, and listing the proper service temperatures
• Holding and reheating information, describing procedures, equipment, times, and
temperatures for safe storage
• Critical control points (CCPs) at appropriate stages in the recipe to indicate temperatures
and times for safe food-handling procedures during storage, preparation, holding, and
reheating

RECIPE CALCULATIONS
Often you will need to modify a recipe. Sometimes a recipe must be increased or decreased.
You may be adapting a recipe from another source into a standardized format, or you may
be adjusting a standardized recipe for a special event such as a banquet or a reception. You
may need to convert from volume measures to weight, or from metric measurements to the
U.S. system. You will also need to be able to translate between purchase units and recipe
measurements. In some circumstances, you may be called upon to increase or decrease the
suggested portion size for a recipe. Or you may want to determine how much the food in a
particular recipe costs.

Using a Recipe Conversion Factor (RCF)
to Convert Recipe Yields
To adjust the yield of a recipe to make either more or less, you need to determine the recipe
conversion factor. Once you know that factor, you first multiply all the ingredient amounts by
it. Then you convert the new measurements into appropriate recipe units for your kitchen.
This may require converting items listed originally as a count into a weight or a volume, or
rounding measurements into reasonable quantities. In some cases, you will have to make a
judgment call about those ingredients that do not scale up or down exactly, such as spices,
salt, and thickeners.
Desired yield
Receipe Conversion Factor RCF
Original yield
Note: The desired yield and the original yield must be expressed in the same way before you
can use the formula. If your original recipe says it makes five portions, for example, but does
not list the amount of each portion, you may need to test the recipe to determine what size
portion it actually makes if you wish to change portion size as well. Similarly, if the original
recipe lists the yield in fluid ounces and you want to make 3 quarts, you need to convert
quarts into fluid ounces before you can determine the recipe conversion factor.
The new ingredient amounts usually need some additional fine-tuning. You may need to
round the result or convert it to the most logical unit of measure. For some ingredients,
a straightforward increase or decrease is all that is needed. For example, to increase a
recipe for chicken breasts from five servings to fifty, you would simply multiply 5 chicken

chapter 2 • MENUS AND RECIPES | 23

breasts by 10; no further adjustments are necessary. Other ingredients, such as thickeners,
aromatics, seasonings, and leavenings, may not multiply as simply, however. If a soup to
serve four requires 2 tablespoons of flour to make a roux, it is not necessarily true that you
will need 20 tablespoons (1¼ cups) of flour to thicken the same soup when you prepare it for
forty. The only way to be sure is to test the new recipe and adjust it until you are satisfied with
the result—­and then be sure to record the measure!
Other considerations when converting recipe yields include the equipment you have to work
with, the production issues you face, and the skill level of your staff. Rewrite the steps to
suit your establishment at this point. It is important to do this now, so you can uncover any
further changes to the ingredients or methods that the new yield might force. For instance,
a soup to serve four would be made in a small pot, but a soup for forty requires a larger
cooking vessel. However, using a larger vessel might result in a higher rate of evaporation, so
you may find that you need to cover the soup as it cooks or increase the liquid to offset the
evaporation.

Converting Portion Sizes
Sometimes it will happen that you also need to modify the portion size of a recipe. For
instance, say you have a soup recipe that makes four 8-ounce portions, but you need to make
enough to have forty 6-ounce portions.
To make the conversion:

1

Determine the total original yield and the total desired yield of the recipe.
Number of portions Portion size Total yield

EXAMPLE
4 8 fl oz 32 fl oz Total original yield
40 6 fl oz 240 fl oz Total desired yield

Determine the recipe conversion factor and modify the recipe as described above.

7.5 Recipe conversion factor

Confusion often arises between weight and volume measures when ounces are the unit
of measure. It is important to remember that weight is measured in ounces, but volume
is measured in fluid ounces. A standard volume measuring cup is equal to 8 fluid ounces,
but the contents of the cup may not always weigh 8 ounces. One cup (8 fluid ounces)
of cornflakes weighs only 1 ounce, but one cup (8 fluid ounces) of peanut butter weighs
9 ounces. Water is the only substance for which it can be safely assumed that 1 fluid ounce
equals 1 ounce. For all other ingredients, when the amount is expressed in ounces, weigh it;
when the amount is expressed in fluid ounces, measure it with an accurate liquid (or volume)
measuring tool.

Converting Volume Measures to Weight
You can convert a volume measure into a weight if you know how much one cup of an
ingredient (prepared as required by the recipe) weighs. This information is available in a

24 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

number of charts or ingredient databases. (See Weights and Measures Equivalents, page A-4.)
You can also calculate and record the information yourself as follows:

1

Prepare the ingredient as directed by the recipe—­sift flour, chop nuts, mince garlic, grate
cheeses, and so forth.

2

Set the measuring device on the scale and reset the scale to zero (known as tare).

3

Fill the measuring device correctly. For liquids, use graduated measuring cups or
pitchers and fill to the desired level. To be sure that you have measured accurately, bend
down until the level mark on the measure is at your eye level. The measuring utensil
must be sitting on a level surface for an accurate measurement. Use nested measuring
tools for dry ingredients measured by volume. Overfill the measure, then scrape away
the excess as you level off the measure.

4

Return the filled measuring tool to the scale and record the weight in either grams or
ounces on your standardized recipe.

Converting Between U.S. and Metric
Measurement Systems
The metric system, used throughout most of the world, is a decimal system, meaning that it
is based on multiples of 10. The gram is the basic unit of weight, the liter is the basic unit of
volume, and the meter is the basic unit of length. Prefixes added to the basic units indicate
larger or smaller units. For instance, a kilogram is 1000 grams, a milliliter is 1/1000 liter, and a
centimeter is 1/100 meter.
The U.S. system, familiar to most Americans, uses ounces and pounds to measure weight,
and teaspoons, tablespoons, fluid ounces, cups, pints, quarts, and gallons to measure
volume. Unlike the metric system, the U.S. system is not based on multiples of a particular
number, so it is not as simple to increase or decrease quantities. Instead, either the
equivalencies of the different units of measure must be memorized or a chart must be kept
handy (see page A-4).
Most modern measuring equipment is capable of measuring in both U.S. and metric units. If,
however, a recipe is written in a system of measurement for which you do not have the proper
measuring equipment, you will need to convert to the other system.

Calculating As-Purchased Cost (APC)
Most food items purchased from suppliers are packed and priced by wholesale bulk sizes
such as by the crate, case, bag, and carton. Yet in kitchen production, the packed amount is
not always used for the same purpose and may often be broken down and used for several
items. Therefore, in order to allocate the proper prices to each recipe, it is necessary to
convert purchase pack prices to unit prices, which are expressed as price per pound, each, by
the dozen, by the quart, and the like.
If you know the cost of a pack with many units, calculate the cost per unit by dividing the aspurchased cost of the pack by the number of units in the pack.
APC

If you know the unit price of an item, you can determine the total cost by multiplying the aspurchased cost (APC) per unit by the number of units.

Calculating the Yield of Fresh Fruits and
­Vegetables and Determining Yield Percent
For many food items, trimming is required before the items are actually used. In order to
determine an accurate cost for these items, the trim loss must be taken into account. From
this information, the yield percent will be important in determining the quantity that you
need to order.
First, record the as-purchased quantity (APQ) from the invoice, or weigh the item before
trimming or cutting.

EXAMPLE
APQ 5 lb

80 oz carrots

Trim the item and cut as desired, saving trim and edible portion quantity in separate
containers. Weigh each separately and record their weights on a costing form:
As purchased quantity APQ

Trim loss Edible portion quantity EPQ

EXAMPLE
80 oz carrots APQ

8.8 oz carrot trim 71.2 oz sliced carrots

Next, divide the EPQ by the APQ:
Edible portion quantity
As-purchased quantity

Yield percent

EXAMPLE
71.2 oz sliced carrots EPQ
80 oz carrots APQ

0.89

To convert the decimal to a percent, multiply by 100: Yield percent = 89%
Note: For more information on any of the above culinary math topics, refer to Math for the

Professional Kitchen by Laura Dreesen, Michael Nothnagel, and Susan Wysocki.

Calculating the As-Purchased Quantity (APQ)
Using Yield Percent
Because many recipes assume the ingredients listed are ready to cook, it is necessary to
consider the trim loss when purchasing items. In this case, the edible portion quantity must
be converted to the as-purchased quantity that when trimmed will give the desired edible
portion quantity. The yield percent is used as a tool when ordering.
EPQ

26 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

APQ

EXAMPLE
A recipe requires 20 pounds of cleaned shredded cabbage. The yield percent for
cabbage is 79 percent. When the 20 pounds is divided by 79 percent (0.79), the result
equals 25.3 pounds, which will be the minimum amount to purchase.
Generally, the as-purchased quantity obtained by this method is rounded up, since the
yield percent is an estimate. Some chefs increase the figure by an additional 10 percent
to account for human error as well. It should be kept in mind that not all foods have a
loss. Many processed or refined foods have a 100 percent yield, such as sugar, flour, or
dried spices. Other foods have a yield percent that depends on how they are served. If,
for example, the ingredient is to be served by the piece (half a cantaloupe), or if a recipe
calls for it by count (15 strawberries), the yield percent is not considered; the correct
number of items must be purchased in order to create the correct number of servings.
However, if you are making a fruit salad and you know you need 2 ounces of cubed melon
and 1 ounce of sliced strawberries per serving, you must consider the yield percent when
ordering.

Calculating Edible Portion Quantity (EPQ)
Using Yield Percent
Sometimes it is necessary for you to determine how many portions can be obtained from
raw product. For example, if you have a case of fresh green beans that weighs 20 pounds
and you need to know how many 4-ounce servings are in the case, what you need to do first
is determine the yield percent for green beans, either by referring to a list of yield percent
values or by performing a yield test. Once you know the yield percent, you can compute the
weight of the green beans after trimming.
APQ Yield percent EPQ

EXAMPLE
20 lb green beans APQ

0.88 Yield percent

17.6 lb green beans EPQ

The edible portion quantity (EPQ) would be 17.6 pounds. The second step would be to
compute how many 4-ounce servings there are in 17.6 pounds. If necessary, convert the
portion size (here, 4 ounces) to the same unit of measure as the edible portion quantity
(here, 1 pound). There are 16 ounces in 1 pound; 1 portion is equal to 1/4 (or 0.25) pound.
EPQ
Number of servings
Portion size

EXAMPLE
17.6 lb green beans EPQ
0.25 lb serving size

70.4 servings

You would be able to obtain 70 full servings from the case of green beans. You should round
down any partial number of portions since it would not be plausible to serve a partial portion
to a guest.

Calculating Edible Portion Cost
As discussed earlier, recipes often assume ingredients are ready to cook, so when it comes
to costing a recipe, the edible portion cost (EPC) per unit can be calculated from the

chapter 2 • MENUS AND RECIPES | 27

as-purchased cost (APC) per unit, as long as the edible portion is expressed in the same unit
of measure as the cost unit.

Calculating the Value of Usable Trim
Often, some of the trimmings from a food may be used to prepare other foods. For example,
if you have tournéed a carrot, rather than cutting it into dice or rounds, you can use the trim
to prepare a soup, purée, or other dish. Using the information from your yield test, you can
calculate the value of the trim. First, determine the use for the trim, then find the cost per unit
and yield percent for that ingredient, as if you had to buy it to prepare the dish. For instance,
if you use the trim from carrot tournées to prepare a soup, the food cost for the carrot trim is
the same as for a carrot that has been trimmed and chopped.

EXAMPLE
$0.106 As-purchased cost of carrots per ounce
$0.89 Yield percent for chopped carrot

$0.119 (Value of usable carrot trim
for soup per ounce)

Some products produce trim that can be used in a variety of ways. For example, a strip loin
produces trimmings that can be used in several recipes. The chef may use some of the
trim to prepare a clarification that might otherwise require ground meat, and more of the
trim to make a filling for fajitas. Finding additional uses for trim reduces costs and helps to
eliminate waste.

USING RECIPES EFFECTIVELY
In the professional kitchen, a recipe can be used to improve efficiency and organization and
to increase profits. When you know the approximate yield percent for onions and carrots,
you can get the right amount for a recipe in a single visit to the walk-in. If you understand
the difference between the price you paid per pound for a whole beef tenderloin and how
much you are actually paying per pound for the trimmed meat you serve, you can be more
effective at reducing loss and decreasing the operation’s overall food costs. Learning to read
recipes carefully and using them more productively is an important step in developing your
professional skills.

THE BUTCHER’S YIELD TEST
The purpose of a butcher’s yield test is to find the accurate costs of fabricated meats, fish,
and poultry. This is done to determine the amount of usable meat and trim from a particular
fabrication and to calculate the value of all edible cuts, including not only the portion of meat
served to the guest but also the value of bones used for stock and of trim used for ground
meat, pâtés, soups, or other dishes.

General Procedures
Select the item to be tested and record the as-purchased weight. (Make sure you use the
same scale for the entire test.) Fabricate the item to desired specifications. Keep all parts
(bones, fat, usable cuts, and usable trim) in separate tubs or trays, and record all weights.
Use current prices for the meat item as purchased. Use market values for fat, bones, and
usable trim. For instance, if you save the lean meat to make ground meat, the value of that
part of the trim is the price you would have to pay to purchase ground meat.

SUSTAINABILITY
The food industry is intrinsically woven into the fabric of culture. The industry and every
profession within it reflect cultural and societal changes, some superficial while others are
foundational. These reflections can be seen in almost every aspect of the industry, such as
how food is prepared, what kinds and types of food are eaten more readily, and menu and
recipe development.
Today’s chefs are more aware of the systems in place for growing and producing the food
we eat. It is important to be educated not only to answer questions that may arise from
customers and diners but also to be able to make educated choices for ourselves.
In the world of food, “sustainability” refers to healthy ways of raising, growing, and harvesting
food and ensuring that the land can support both the grower and the crop into the future.
It is not simply healthy for consumers but for plants, animals, and the environment as well.
Sustainable farming does not harm the environment through the use of harmful pesticides
or genetically modified organisms (GMOs), or through overfarming. Sustainable farms also
take care of their workers and are humane toward animals; sustainable agriculture respects
the farmers by paying them a fair wage. Sustainability is meant to support and improve the
community, especially the rural communities where farms are based.
Consumers, chefs, and restaurateurs are all becoming increasingly aware of the positive
effects of sustainability and how to live a sustainable lifestyle. A restaurant can support
sustainability in a number of ways:

1

Buy locally. This allows the chef to know the quality and conditions under which the
food they are using is raised, grown, or harvested. Buying locally increases awareness
of seasonality and supports the local economy—items that have traveled far have often
lost quality and freshness. This concept also appeals to customers who are becoming
more aware of the importance of sustainability and use of local products.

2

Use heirloom products. Heirloom products are different from most available
commercially. An “heirloom plant” is defined as any garden plant that has been passed
down within a food family. Some heirloom seeds are from plants 50 to 100 years old
(making them entirely free of GMOs) and have a unique genetic composition compared
with their commercial counterparts. They may provide new textures, colors, and flavors
that chefs can incorporate into any menu. Heirloom products are:.
• open-pollinated, yielding like offspring
• a distinct variety of plant
• generally not commercially grown
• a product of traditional methods
• usually grown on a small scale
• often tied to a particular region
• often has been in use for 40–50 years or more

chapter 2 • MENUS AND RECIPES | 31

3

Build a sustainable restaurant. Chefs and restaurateurs can use the concepts of
sustainability in other ways in the restaurant—going far beyond simply the food used
on the menu. Using solar or wind power, for example, decreases energy costs and the
use of fossil fuels. The chef can implement a recycling program that includes not only
glass, plastic, or paper but also waste oil that could be converted into biofuel. Check for
local and national resources to learn about the many ways to make a restaurant more
sustainable.

GLOBALIZATION OF FLAVORS
Another ever-changing aspect of the food industry since the beginning of time is the global
sharing and blending of cuisines.
Cuisine, like any cultural element of society, has geographic, religious, and many other
influences that shape its development. Conversely, a cuisine—­once developed—­exerts
influence on the culture of its land of origin as well as on any outside cultures with which it
may come in contact. Elements of the cuisine may shape events or celebrations that become
cultural norms, or may be assimilated into another culture, become intrinsic to it, and then
work to shape or drive agricultural demands and practices.
In this context, any meal is more than mere sustenance. Identifying basic foods and
preparation techniques that translate across cuisines, cultures, and continents is an
important part of the culinary profession. Any cuisine reflects more than just a collection of
ingredients, cooking utensils, and dishes from a geographic location. These elements are
undoubtedly critical to establishing a culinary identity. But they are not, all on their own,
a cuisine.
Shared traditions and beliefs also give a cuisine a particular identity. A cultural cuisine is
an important element in developing and maintaining a group’s identity. And perhaps most
relevant from today’s perspective, a system of governance and trade that encourages the
“migration” of foods and dishes from one place to another strongly influences cuisine. The
presence or absence of a shoreline has a tremendous impact on a developing cooking style.
Climate and soil composition, as well as farming techniques, also have a strong influence.
A cuisine also gives us a way to express and establish customs for meals (what is eaten,
when, and with whom), from simple meals to celebrations and ritual meals. By taking a look
at some of the world’s major religions, it is easy to see their influence on cuisine. Edicts
favoring or prohibiting certain foods, as well as a calendar of feasting, fasting, and celebrating
rituals, are often widespread enough in an area to color the way that a cuisine evolves
and what is widely held to be authentic. For example, with its proscription against eating
meat for certain castes, Hinduism has contributed to a cuisine with a strong tradition of
meatless dishes.
There has probably never been a time when the migration of foods from one part of the world
to another has not been a factor in a developing cuisine. While these exchanges are more
rapid and frequent in modern times, they have always been apparent. Sometimes these
exchanges had a great deal to do with the conquest of lands by an invading force. Other
times, trade and its associated activities played a major role.

32 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

Whether benign or aggressive, a system of culinary exchange is part of any cuisine’s story.
New ingredients find their way into traditional dishes. Over time, the new ingredient becomes
so firmly entrenched, we may even forget that the dish would not be recognized as authentic.
A clear example of this can be seen with the adoption of many ingredients that were native
to the Americas, such as the tomato. Today, who could imagine Italian cuisine without the
tomato? It is so embedded in the country’s cuisine that anyone could easily mistake Italy as
its land of origin.
Techniques are also a window into the cooking of a specific cuisine. As you might expect,
a technique can have a different name as you travel from one region to another. Certain
cooking styles are popular in a given region of the world because they are suited to the
lifestyle and living conditions; others may remain virtually unknown.
The study of any single cuisine is a multifaceted undertaking. Cuisines have never developed
in a vacuum. As you probe more deeply into the historical origins of the recipe in your hand
today, you may find ingredients that traveled from East to West or from the Old World to
the New World in place of an earlier option. Traditional methods of cooking a dish may have
changed with the times or to meet the special challenges of cooking for large groups or in a
restaurant setting.
It is essential to understand the classic techniques and cuisine of a culture (whether France,
India, or beyond) before choosing to modernize or change a traditional recipe. Consult
experts, read cookbooks, visit restaurants and other countries, and keep an open mind to
experience a wide variety of world cuisines.

CHAPTER 3

BASICS OF
FOOD SCIENCE
Cooking is science in action—­a
series of reactions that create
flavor, texture, and aroma. As an
introduction to the topic of food
science, this chapter provides an
overview of the most basic of these
principles.

SIX BASIC PRINCIPLES
OF FOOD SCIENCE
Understanding how food reacts under certain conditions is essential to becoming a
professional chef. From creating a flavorful dish to developing an innovative shortcut, chefs
face challenges every day.
The six basic principles of food science are as follows:
Heat Transfer
Caramelization and Maillard browning
Gelation
Denaturation
Coagulation
Emulsification

Heat Transfer
Cooking is the act of applying heat to foods to prepare them for eating. When foods are
cooked, changes in flavor, texture, aroma, color, and nutritional content occur during
the process.
There are three ways that heat is transferred to foods: conduction, convection, and radiation.

Conduction
Conduction is the transfer of heat between the molecules of objects that are in direct
physical contact. Basically, this is how a cool item heats up when it touches something hotter
than itself, and it is the most common form of heat transfer in the kitchen. Heat spreads
from a heat source to the molecules of a cooking surface, and from there, to the molecules
in the food.
An example of conduction is cooking in a pan on a flattop range. Heat is transferred from the
molecules of the hot range surface to the molecules of the adjacent pan bottom, then from
the pan bottom to the pan sides and the food contained within the pan. The pan must be in
direct contact with the range for conduction to occur.
Some materials are better conductors of heat than others. Generally, most metals are good
conductors, while gases (air), liquids, and nonmetallic solids (glass, ceramic) are not.

Convection
Convection is the transfer of heat through gases or liquids. When either of these substances
is heated, the portion of the gas or liquid closest to the heat source warms first and becomes
less dense, causing it to rise and be replaced by cooler, denser portions of the gas or liquid.
Cooking with convection means that ingredients are in constant contact with a heated gas or
liquid, thanks to that movement.
Convection occurs both naturally and through mechanical means. Natural convection is at
work in a pot of water placed on the stove to boil. Conduction transfers heat from the stove

36 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

to the pot to the water molecules in contact with the interior of the pot. As
these water molecules heat up, convection causes them to move away and be
replaced by cooler molecules. This continual movement results in convection
currents within the water. If a potato is added to the water, the convection
currents transfer heat to the surface of the potato, at which point conduction
takes over to transfer heat to the interior of the potato.
Mechanical convection is what we usually think of when we talk about
convection in cooking. It is when the convection motion of hot air or steam is
helped along by a device, usually a fan, in an oven. The extra movement speeds
up the convection motion. And this means that the heat transfer between the
gas or liquid and the ingredient happens faster.

Radiation
Radiation is the transfer of energy through waves of electromagnetic energy
that travel rapidly through space. Radiation does not require direct contact
between the energy source and food. When the waves traveling through space
strike matter and are absorbed, they cause molecules in the matter to vibrate
more rapidly, increasing the temperature. Two types of radiation are important
in the kitchen: infrared and microwave.
Infrared radiation is invisible light wave energy. It comes from glowing coals, or

it faster than infrared radiation, which is mainly absorbed at the surface.
Depending on their composition, foods react differently to microwaves. Foods
with high moisture, sugar, or fat content absorb microwaves best and heat up
more readily.
Microwave cooking has a few drawbacks, however. It is best suited to cooking
small batches of foods. Meats cooked in a microwave oven lose greater
amounts of moisture and easily become dry. Microwave ovens also cannot
brown foods, and metal cannot be used in them because it reflects the
microwaves, which can cause fires and damage the oven.

Cooking is a complex process, and the three types of heat transfer often overlap. For example, when
grilling, heat is transferred to the food in all three ways:
1. Conduction: The hot grates directly transfer heat to the food.
2. Convection: Hot air rises off the grates and circulates around the food, creating a flow of heat.
3. Radiation: The hot grates radiate infrared waves, causing the food’s molecules to vibrate and the food to
heat up.

Effects of Heat on Sugars and Starches:
Caramelization, Maillard Reaction,
and Gelation
Carbohydrates come in various forms, and each form reacts differently when exposed to
heat. The two forms of carbohydrates (simple and complex) that are of interest from a basic
food science perspective are sugar and starch.
When exposed to heat, sugar will at first melt into a thick syrup. As its temperature continues
to rise, the sugar syrup changes color from clear to light yellow to a progressively deepening
brown. This browning process is called caramelization. It is a complicated chemical reaction,
and in addition to color change, it also causes the flavor of the sugar to evolve and take on
the rich complexity that we know to be characteristic of caramel. Different types of sugar
caramelize at different temperatures. Granulated white sugar melts at 320°F/160°C and
begins to caramelize at 338°F/170°C.
In foods that are not primarily sugar or starch, a different reaction, known as the Maillard
reaction, is responsible for browning. This reaction involves sugars
and amino acids (the building blocks of protein). When heated, these
components react and produce numerous chemical by-­products,
resulting in a brown color and intense flavor and aroma. It is this
reaction that gives coffee, chocolate, baked goods, dark beer, and
roasted meats and nuts much of their rich flavor and color.
Though the Maillard reaction can happen at room temperature, both
caramelization and the Maillard reaction typically require relatively
high heat (above 300°F/149°C) to occur rapidly enough to make an
appreciable difference in foods. Because water cannot be heated above
212°F/100°C unless it is under pressure, foods cooked with moist heat
(boiling, steaming, poaching, or stewing) will not brown. Foods cooked
using dry-­heat methods (sautéing, grilling, or roasting) will brown. It
is for this reason that many stewed and braised dishes begin with an
initial browning of ingredients before liquid is added.
Starch, a complex carbohydrate, has powerful thickening properties.
When starch is combined with water or another liquid and heated,
individual starch granules absorb the liquid and swell. This process,
Foods using dry heat methods, like grilling, will brown
through the Maillard reaction.

38 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

known as gelation, is what causes the liquid to thicken. Gelation
occurs at different temperatures for different types of starch. As a

rule of thumb, root-­based starches (potato and arrowroot, for instance) thicken at lower
temperatures and break down more quickly, whereas cereal-­based starches (e.g., corn and
wheat) thicken at higher temperatures and break down more slowly. High levels of sugar or
acid can inhibit gelation, while the presence of salt can promote it.

Denaturing Proteins and Coagulation
At the molecular level, natural proteins are shaped like coils or springs. When natural proteins
are exposed to heat, salt, or acid, they denature—­that is, their coils unwind. When proteins
denature, they tend to bond together, or coagulate, and form solid clumps. Coagulation is a
process that firms up the texture of proteins.
An example of this is a cooked egg white, which changes from a transparent fluid to an
opaque solid. As proteins coagulate, they lose some of their capacity to hold water, which is
why protein-­rich foods give off moisture as they cook, even if they are steamed or poached.
Fortunately, some heat-­induced denaturation is reversible through cooling. This is why
roasted foods should be allowed to rest before carving; as the temperature falls, some of the
water (“juice”) that was forced into spaces between the proteins is reabsorbed and the food
becomes moister. Denatured proteins are easier to digest than natural proteins.
Proteins can overcoagulate if exposed to heat, salt, or acid for too long. The protein
molecules will coagulate, shrink, and toughen. Moisture will be forced out, leaving dry, bland
food behind.

Function of Cooking Fats
Depending on their molecular structure, some fats are solid at room temperature, while
others are liquid at the same temperature. Fats that are liquid at room temperature are
known as oils. Solid fats soften and eventually melt into a liquid state when exposed to heat.
In addition to being a vital nutrient, fat performs several culinary functions. It provides
a rich flavor and silky mouthfeel or texture that most people find very enjoyable and
satisfying. Fat also carries and blends the flavors of other foods, and makes available to
us flavor compounds and nutrients that are soluble only in fat. Fat provides an appealing
visual element when a food appears, among other things, to be moist, creamy, fluffy, or
shiny. During the baking process, fat performs a multitude of chemical functions such as
tenderizing, leavening, aiding in moisture retention, and creating a flaky or crumbly texture. In
cooking, fat transfers heat to foods and prevents them from sticking. It also holds the heat in
food, emulsifies or thickens sauces, and creates a crisp texture when used for frying.
One important aspect of fat is its ability to be heated to relatively high temperatures without
boiling or otherwise breaking down. This is what allows fried foods to brown and cook quickly.
If heated to high enough temperatures, however, fat will begin to break down and develop an
acrid flavor, effectively ruining anything cooked in it. The temperature at which this occurs,
known as the smoke point, is different for each fat. Generally, vegetable oils begin to smoke
around 450°F/232°C, while animal fats begin to smoke around 375°F/191°C. Any additional
materials in the fat (emulsifiers, preservatives, proteins, and carbohydrates) lower the smoke
point. Because some breakdown occurs at moderate temperatures and food particles tend to
get left in the fat, repeated use of fat also lowers the smoke point.

Moisture Management
Cooking is often focused on bringing about desired changes caused by transferring heat to
the natural moistures found in an ingredient itself. Generally, the approach taken to transfer
heat to the food is defined as the cooking technique. Depending on the type of technique
selected, and how it is applied, cooking can lead to transformations yielding a wide range
of results. Traditionally, culinary education surrounding basic cooking techniques focused
on the preparation of meat, poultry, and fish; yet the techniques are equally relevant to the
cooking of plant-­based ingredients like vegetables, roots, grains, and legumes.
The ability to prepare foods in a variety of flavorful, delicious ways is central to the kitchen.
Whether you plan to steam, sauté, roast, grill, stew, or use some combination of methods,
understanding what happens when foods cook is a critical first step to achieving success in
applying your technique.
No matter what cooking technique you deploy, it is important to recognize that nearly all
forms of ingredients technically cook from within as they are heated. The natural moisture
trapped within the cell walls of food is warmed through the conduction of heat transferred
from the exterior as it penetrates inward. As those moistures are heated, a variety of
things happen, including: the activation of chemical reactions that change the food’s flavor
and color, the volatilization of compounds that gives the cooked food its aroma, and the
breakdown of cell walls that causes foods to become more tender. As the cell walls break
down, the moisture from within the food is released. Some of that moisture will be driven out
of the food toward the exterior where it will either evaporate as steam or dissolve into the
cooking medium itself.
The release of moisture from within foods through the surface is important when cooking for
a variety of reasons. First, it is important to understand that while moisture is escaping from
an ingredient, care needs to be taken to prevent the loss of flavor. This is demonstrated in
a pan after boiling vegetables in which traces of the vegetable color left behind in the water
to be discarded are evidence of nutrient and flavor loss. Ways to reduce this loss are to boil
the vegetable as quickly as possible to reduce the amount of time spent in contact with the
cooking liquid or to choose a cooking method in which lost moisture is re-­captured such as
stewing, glazing, or roasting. Another, more viable approach to boiling is to choose a cooking
method that prevents the leaching of nutrients such as steaming. Steaming yields much the
same outcomes as boiling, but the heat is transferred to the vegetable through contact with
the hot vapor and this eliminates the potential of leaching.
On the other hand, the transfer of a food’s moisture into a cooking medium can, at times, be
the goal. Such is the case in the preparation of stocks, soups, and even stews, where the long
slow simmering allows the creation of a flavorful broth as the result of transferring of flavors
and colors from within the ingredients into the cooking medium.
Another important aspect of natural moisture escaping from foods is that certain
techniques rely on the driving off of surface moisture, through evaporation, in order for other
transformations to take place, such as browning. Given that both caramelization and Maillard
reaction take place only at temperatures above 230°F/110°C and that water cannot reach
temperatures above 212°F/100°C, cooking techniques such as roasting, grilling, and sautéing
actually rely on the rapid driving away of surface moisture. It’s only when the food’s surface
becomes dehydrated enough to allow its temperature to rise past the boiling point of water

40 | THE CULINARY PROFESSIONAL

will any browning take place. Therefore, achieving browned foods means high
heat and preventing the trapping of steam in the cooking process.

pH of Foods
Pigment, pH, cell density, and cooking time are all considerations when
determining cooking methods to reach your desired outcome.
• Because pigment and cellulose—­both found within plant foods—­are
sensitive to pH and cooking times, cooking mediums and techniques need
to be carefully considered.
• The green pigment, chlorophyll, found in green vegetables will become
drab in color when heated too long, or when exposed to acidic
environments such as those with vinegar, citrus juice, and even wine.
• To counteract the slight acidity of tap water found in some local sources,
it is often prescribed to add salt to the cooking water for green vegetables
and cook them quickly and cool them immediately if they are not to be
served right away.
• On the other hand, purple pigmented vegetables such as beets and red
cabbage tend to turn brownish/blue when cooked in alkaline-­leaning
cooking mediums and therefore adding acids such as wines and vinegars

Adding acid, like wine or vinegar, to purple
pigmented foods can be beneficial for color

are beneficial for color retention.
• To complicate this topic even further, cellulose, the plant material that gives vegetables
their structure, is tenderized by alkaline and toughened by acid.
• Suffice it to say, the pH of the cooking medium for vegetables is important and
understanding the effects allows a chef to predict and control their results.
• Vegetable structure and cell density are also important considerations.
Choosing the proper cooking method will help you control labor productivity, properly
leverage equipment resources, lead to a quality result, and even help in retaining
nutrient quality.

Forming Emulsions
An emulsion occurs when two substances that do not normally mix are forced into a mixture
in which one of the substances is evenly dispersed in the form of small droplets throughout
the other. Under normal conditions, fat (either liquid oil or solid fat) and water do not mix, but
these two substances are the most common ingredients in culinary emulsions.
An emulsion appears to be a completely homogenous mixture but is in fact what is known
as a two-­phase system, having a dispersed phase and a continuous phase. When mixed to
combine, one of the liquids breaks up into minute droplets (dispersed phase) and the other
remains as a matrix for the droplets to be dispersed in (continuous phase).
Temporary emulsions, such as vinaigrettes, form quickly and require only the mechanical
action of whipping, shaking, or stirring. To make an emulsion stable enough to keep the oil
in suspension, additional ingredients, known as emulsifiers, are necessary to attract and
hold together both the oil and liquid. Emulsifiers are naturally occurring substances that are
attracted to both fat and water and thus facilitate maintaining a stable emulsion between

chapter 3 • BASICS OF FOOD SCIENCE | 41

two immiscible liquids. Commonly used emulsifiers include egg yolks (which contain the
emulsifier lecithin), mustard, and glace de viande. Natural starches, such as those in garlic, or
modified starches, such as cornstarch or arrowroot, are also used.

Low and Slow Cooking
Low and slow cooking is a culinary technique that involves cooking food at a low temperature
over an extended period. This method is used for tough cuts of meat, such as brisket, ribs,
pork shoulder, and certain types of poultry, which have a lot of connective tissue and require
slow cooking to break down and become tender.
The cooking temperature used for low and slow roasting is usually in the range of 200° to
300°F/95° to 150°C, and the cooking time can vary depending on the size and thickness of
the meat, but often ranges from several hours to even half a day or more.
The science behind low and slow cooking revolves around a few key principles as follows.

Breakdown of Collagen
One of the primary benefits of slow cooking is the breakdown of collagen in tough cuts
of meat. Collagen is a fibrous protein found in connective tissues that makes meat tough
and chewy. Collagen breaks down into gelatin when the meat maintains a temperature of
160°F/70°C for a prolonged period. However, at around 140° to 150°F/60° to 65°C, muscle
fibers begin to lose their juices. To transform tough meats into succulent delights, the secret
lies in slow cooking, ideally just above the collagen-­dissolving minimum, to minimize moisture
loss from the fibers. When meat is cooked slowly at low temperatures, the collagen gradually
converts into gelatin, resulting in a tender and succulent texture.

Protein Denaturation
Slow cooking allows proteins in the meat to denature slowly. The heat causes the proteins
to unwind and then reassemble in a way that enhances the meat’s juiciness and tenderness.
Proteins denature under exposure to heat, usually between 140° and 180°F/60° and 80°C.

Fat and Flavor Rendering
As the meat cooks slowly, fat and other flavors are rendered out of the meat, infusing it with
rich flavor and creating a moist and tender end product.
To achieve low and slow cooking, various methods are employed:
• Smoking or barbecuing: Cooking food over indirect heat with wood chips or charcoal,
which imparts a distinct smoky flavor. See more on page 430.
• Roasting: Cooking the meat in an oven at a low temperature for an extended period of
time. See more on page 411.
• Braising: Browning the meat first, then cooking it in a liquid at a low temperature for an
extended period, often in a covered pot. See more on page 537.
• Sous vide: A technique where food is vacuum-­sealed and cooked in a water bath at a
precise low temperature for a long time. See more on page 595.

EQUIPMENT
IDENTIFICATION
Tools, large and small, make it
possible for chefs to do their jobs
well; in fact, using the right tool for
the job is one of the hallmarks of a
professional. Equally important is the
ability to handle and care for each
tool, whether it is a cutting board, a
knife, a mandoline, or a stockpot.

KNIVES
Assembling a personal collection of knives is one of the first steps in becoming a professional.
Just as an artist or craftsperson gathers the tools necessary for painting, sculpting, or
drawing, you will need to select knives that allow you to do your work in the safest and most
efficient way. The knives you choose will become as important to you as your own fingers—­
quite literally an extension of your own hands.

1

Handle knives with respect. Knives can be damaged if they are handled carelessly. Even
though good-­quality knives are manufactured to last a lifetime, they are still prone to
damage if not properly taken care of.

2

Keep knives sharp. Learn the proper techniques for both sharpening and honing
knives. A sharp knife not only performs better, but is safer to use because less effort is
required to cut through the food. There are many ways to sharpen knives. Use a stone
periodically, a sharpening machine, or send them to a professional cutlery sharpener.

3

Keep knives clean. Clean knives thoroughly immediately after using them. Sanitize the
entire knife, including the handle, bolster, and blade, as necessary, so that the tool will
not cross-contaminate food. Do not clean knives in a dishwasher.

4

Use safe handling procedures for knives. There are standards of behavior that should
be remembered when using knives. When you are passing a knife, lay it down on a work
surface so that the handle is extended toward the person who will pick it up. Whenever
you must carry a knife from one area of the kitchen to another, hold the knife straight
down at your side with the sharp edge facing behind you, and let people know you are
passing by with something sharp. When you lay a knife down on a work surface, be sure
that no part of it extends over the edge of the cutting board or worktable. Also, do not
cover the knife with food, towels, equipment, and the like. Be sure the blade is facing
away from the edge of the work surface. Do not attempt to catch a falling knife.

5

Use an appropriate cutting surface. Cutting directly on metal, glass, or marble surfaces
will dull and eventually damage the blade of a knife. To prevent dulling, always use
wooden or composition cutting boards.

6

Keep knives properly stored. There are several safe, practical ways to store knives,
including in knife kits or rolls, slots, or racks, and on magnetized holders. Storage
systems should be kept just as clean as knives.

The Parts of a Knife
To select a knife of good quality that fits your hand well and is suitable for the intended task,
you need a basic knowledge of the various parts of a knife.

Blades
Currently, the most frequently used material for blades is high-­carbon stainless steel. Other
materials, such as stainless steel and carbon steel, are also available.
Although carbon-­steel blades take a better edge than either regular or high-­carbon stainless
steel, they tend to lose their sharpness quickly. Also, carbon-­steel blades will discolor
when they come into contact with acidic foods. The metal is brittle and can break easily
under stress.

48 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

Stainless steel is much stronger than carbon steel and will not discolor or

Tip

rust. It is difficult to get a good edge on a stainless-­steel blade; although once
an edge is established, it tends to last longer than the edge on a carbon-­
steel blade.
High-­carbon stainless steel is a relatively recent development that combines
the advantages of carbon steel and stainless steel. The higher percentage of
carbon allows the blade to take and keep a keener edge.
The most desirable type of blade for general use is taper-­ground, meaning
that the blade has been forged out of a single sheet of metal and has been
ground so that it tapers smoothly from the spine to the cutting edge, with no

Edge

apparent beveling.

Spine

Hollow-­ground blades are made by combining two sheets of metal. The edges
are then beveled or fluted.

Tangs
The tang is a continuation of the blade that extends into the knife’s handle.

Heel

Knives used for heavy work, such as chef’s knives or cleavers, should have a full
tang; that is, the tang is almost as long as the entire handle. Although blades

Bolster

with partial tangs are not as durable, they are acceptable on knives that will be
used less frequently. Rat-­tail tangs are much narrower than the spine of the
blade and are encased in the handle.

Handle
Rivets

Handles
A preferred material for knife handles is rosewood, because it is extremely hard
and has a very tight or fine grain, which helps prevent splitting and cracking.
Impregnating wood with plastic protects the handle from damage caused by
continued exposure to water and detergents. The handle should fit your hand
comfortably. A comfortable fit will reduce fatigue.

Parts of a knife

Rivets
Metal rivets are usually used to secure the tang to the handle. The rivets should
be completely smooth and lie flush with the surface of the handle.

Bolsters
In some knives, there is a collar or shank, known as a bolster, at the point where
the blade meets the handle. This is a sign of a well-­made knife. The bolster
helps to balance the knife and protect the hand from accidental slips. Some
knives may have a collar that looks like a bolster but is actually a separate piece
attached to the handle. These knives tend to come apart easily and should
be avoided.

Sharpening and Honing
The key to the proper and efficient use of any knife is making sure that it is sharp. A knife with
a sharp blade always works better and more safely because it cuts easily. Knife blades are
given an edge on a sharpening stone and maintained between sharpenings by honing them
with a steel.
Sharpening stones are essential to the proper maintenance of knives. Sharpen the blade by
passing its edge over the stone at a 20-­degree angle. The grit—­the degree of coarseness or
fineness of the stone’s surface—­abrades the blade’s edge, creating a sharp cutting edge.
When sharpening a knife, always begin by using the coarsest surface of the stone, and then
move on to the finer surfaces.
A stone with a fine grit should be used for boning knives and other tools on which an
especially sharp edge is required. Most stones may be used either dry or moistened with
water or mineral oil.
Carborundum stones have a fine side and a medium side. Arkansas stones are available
in several grades of fineness. Some consist of three stones of varying degrees of fineness
mounted on a wheel. Diamond-­impregnated stones are also available. Although they are
expensive, some chefs prefer them because they feel these stones give a sharper edge.
Opinion is split about whether a knife blade should be run over a stone from heel to tip or tip
to heel. Most chefs do agree that consistency in the direction of the stroke used to pass the
blade over the stone is important.
Before using a stone, be sure that it is properly stabilized. No matter which method you use,
keep the following guidelines in mind:

1

Assemble your mise en place.

2

Anchor the stone to keep it from slipping as you work. Place carborundum or diamond
stones on a damp cloth or rubber mat. A triple-­faced stone is mounted on a rotating
framework that can be locked into position so that it cannot move.

chapter 4 • EQUIPMENT IDENTIFICATION | 51

3

Lubricate the stone with mineral oil or water. Be consistent about the type of lubricant
you use on your stone. Water or mineral oil helps reduce friction as you sharpen your
knife. The heat caused by friction may not seem significant, but it can eventually harm
the blade.

4

Begin sharpening the edge on the coarsest grit you require. The duller the blade, the
coarser the grit should be.

5

Run the entire edge over the surface of the stone, keeping the pressure even on the knife.
Hold the knife at the correct angle as you work. A 20-­degree angle is suitable for chef’s
knives and knives with similar blades. You may need to adjust the angle by a few degrees
to properly sharpen thinner blades, such as slicers, or thicker blades, such as cleavers.

6

Always sharpen the blade in the same direction. This ensures that the edge remains
even and in proper alignment.

7

Make strokes of equal number and equal pressure on each side of the blade. Do not
oversharpen the edge on coarse stones. After about 10 strokes on each side of the blade,
move on to the next finer grit.

8

Finish sharpening on the finest stone, then wash and dry the knife thoroughly before
using or storing it.

Sharpening Method One

1

Use four fingers of the guiding hand to maintain
constant pressure on the knife.

2

Draw the knife across the stone gently.

3

Draw the knife off the stone smoothly. Turn the knife
over and repeat the entire process on the other side.

Sharpening Method Two

1

Push the blade over the stone’s surface, using the

3

guiding hand to keep pressure even.

2

Push the knife off the stone smoothly. Turn the knife
over and repeat the entire process on the other side.

Continue to push the entire length of the blade over
the stone.

Steels A steel should be used both immediately after sharpening the blade with a stone
and also between sharpenings to keep the edge in alignment. The length of the steel’s
working surface can range from 3 inches for a pocket version to over 14 inches. Hard steel
is the traditional material for steels. Other materials, such as glass, ceramic, and diamond-­
impregnated surfaces, are also available.
Steels come with coarse, medium, and fine grains, and some are magnetic, which helps the
blade maintain proper alignment and also collects metal shavings. A guard or hilt between
the steel and the handle protects the user, and a ring on the bottom of the handle can be
used to hang the steel.
When using a steel, hold the knife almost vertically, with the blade at a 20-­degree angle,
resting on the inner side of the steel. Draw the blade along the entire length of the steel.
Keep the following guidelines in mind:
• Allow yourself plenty of room as you work, and stand with your weight evenly distributed.
Hold the steel with your thumb and fingers safely behind the guard.
• Draw the blade along the steel so that the entire edge touches the steel. Work in the same
direction on each side of the blade to keep the edge straight.
• Be sure to keep the pressure even to avoid wearing away the metal in the center of
the edge. Over time, this could produce a curve in the edge. Keep the knife blade at a
20-­degree angle to the steel.
• Use a light touch, stroking evenly and consistently. Lay the blade against the steel; don’t
slap it. Listen for a light ringing sound; a heavy grinding sound indicates that too much
pressure is being applied.
• Repeat the stroke on the opposite side of the edge to properly straighten the edge. If a
blade requires more than five strokes per side on a steel, it probably should be sharpened
on a stone.

POTS, PANS, AND MOLDS
Various materials and combinations of materials are used in the construction
of pots, pans, and molds. Because form and function are closely related, it is
important to choose the proper equipment for the task at hand.
Pots made of copper transfer heat rapidly and evenly but because direct
contact with copper will affect the color and consistency of many foods, copper
pots are generally lined. (An exception is a copper pan used to cook jams,
jellies, chocolates, and other high-­sugar items, often known as a preserving
pan.) Great care must be taken not to scratch linings made of soft metal such
as tin. If the lining becomes scratched or wears away, it may be repaired by
retinning. Copper also tends to discolor quickly; its proper upkeep requires
significant time and labor.
Cast iron has the capacity to hold heat well and transmit it very evenly. The
metal is somewhat brittle and must be treated carefully to prevent pitting,
scarring, and rusting. Cast iron coated with enamel is easier to clean but loses
some of its nonstick properties and cannot withstand as high a temperature as
untreated cast iron. Stainless steel is a relatively poor conductor of heat, but
it is often used because it has other advantages, including easy maintenance.
Other metals, such as aluminum or copper, are often sandwiched with stainless
steel to improve heat conduction. Stainless steel will not react with foods; for
example, white sauces will remain pure white or ivory.
Blue-­steel, black-­steel, pressed-­steel, or rolled-­steel pans are all prone to
discoloration but transmit heat very rapidly. These pans are generally thin and
are often preferred for sautéing foods.

SEASONING PANS
Chefs who use pans made of cast iron
or rolled steel season their pans to seal
the pores. Seasoning preserves the
cooking surface and essentially creates
a nonstick coating. To season a pan,

Pots and Pans for Stovetop Cooking Pots and pans used on the stovetop
may be made from a variety of materials, but they must be able to withstand direct heat
from a flame. A poorly produced pot will have weak spots and will warp. Pans may be made of
many different materials, and selection in large part weighs on preference. Heat conductivity
and evenness of heat transfer are important to consider as well as the maintenance of the
pan; for example, copper is great for conductivity but requires significant time and labor for
proper upkeep. Nonstick coatings may be useful for some applications, but these surfaces
are not as sturdy as metal, so another choice for nonstick cookery would be cast iron. Blue-­
steel and black-­steel, pressed-­steel, or rolled-­steel pans are often preferred for sautéing
because of their quick response to changes in temperature.
When choosing a pot or pan, consider the following information:

1

Choose a size appropriate to the food being cooked. Be familiar with the capacity of
various pots, pans, and molds. If too many pieces of meat are crowded into a sauteuse,
for instance, the food will not brown properly. If the sauteuse is too large, however, the
fond (Maillard drippings from the meat) could scorch. If a small fish is poached in a large
pot, the cuisson (cooking liquid) will not have the proper intensity of flavor.

2

Choose material appropriate to the cooking technique. Experience has shown, and
science has verified, that certain cooking techniques are more successful when used
with certain materials. For instance, sautéed foods require pans that transmit heat
quickly and are sensitive to temperature changes. Braises, on the other hand, require
long, fairly gentle cooking; it is more important that the pot transmit heat evenly and
hold it well than respond rapidly to changes in heat.

3

Use proper handling, cleaning, and storing techniques. Avoid subjecting pots to heat
extremes and rapid changes in temperature (e.g., placing a smoking-­hot pot into a
sinkful of water) because some materials are prone to warping. Other materials may
chip or even crack if allowed to sit over heat when they are empty or if they are handled
roughly. Casseroles or molds made of enameled cast iron or steel are especially
vulnerable.

Pans for Oven Cooking Pans used in ovens are produced from the
same basic materials used to make stovetop pots and pans. Glazed and unglazed
earthenware, glass, and ceramics are also used. The heat of the oven is less intense
than that of a burner, making it possible to use these more delicate materials
without risk of cracking or shattering. Metal pans are available in several gauges
(gauge refers to the thickness of the metal). Heavy-­gauge pans are usually preferred
because they transfer heat more evenly. Regarding heat conductivity, some metals
heat faster than others. Aluminum heats quickly but is susceptible to burning food
if it is a light gauge. On the other hand, stainless steel is a poor conductor of heat
but works best for baking in a lighter gauge. Tin is a good conductor of heat, while
materials such as glass, ceramic, and earthenware hold heat well but transfer
it poorly.

chapter 4 • EQUIPMENT IDENTIFICATION | 61

LARGE EQUIPMENT
When working with large equipment, safety precautions must be observed and proper
maintenance and cleaning done consistently.

1

Obtain proper instruction in the machine’s safe operation.

2

First turn off and then unplug electrical equipment before assembling it or
breaking it down.

3

Use all safety features: Be sure that lids are secure, hand guards are used, and the
machine is stable.

4

Clean and sanitize the equipment thoroughly after each use.

5

Be sure that all pieces of equipment are properly reassembled and left unplugged
after each use.

6

Report any problems or malfunctions promptly and alert coworkers to the problem.

Kettles and Steamers
Kettles and steamers enable a chef to prepare large amounts of food efficiently, since the
heat is applied over a much larger area than is possible when a single burner is used. Cooking
times are often shorter than when using the stovetop.
Steam-­jacketed kettle

This freestanding or tabletop kettle circulates steam through

the double-­sided walls, providing even heat. Units vary; they may tilt, may be insulated,
and may have spigots or lids. Available in a range of sizes, these kettles are excellent for
producing stocks, soups, and sauces.
Tilting kettle

This large, relatively shallow freestanding unit (also known as a Swiss

brasier, tilting skillet, or tilting fry pan) is used for braising, stewing, and sautéing large
quantities of meats or vegetables at one time. Most tilting kettles have lids, allowing for
steaming as well.
Pressure steamer

Water is heated under pressure in a sealed compartment, allowing it

to reach temperatures above the boiling point, 212°F/100°C. Cooking time is controlled
by automatic timers, which open the exhaust valves at the end.
Convection steamer

Steam is generated in a boiler, then piped to the cooking chamber,

where it is vented over the food. Pressure does not build up in the unit; it is continuously
exhausted, which means the door may be opened at any time without danger of scalding
or burning.
Deep-­fat fryer

This consists of a gas or an electric heating element and a large

stainless-­steel reservoir that holds the fat. A thermostat allows the user to control the
temperature of the fat. Stainless-­steel wire mesh baskets are used to lower and lift foods
into and out of the fat.

62 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

Ranges and Ovens
The stovetop is known as the range; the oven is usually below the range. However, there are
a number of variations on this standard arrangement. Gas or electric ranges are available
in many sizes and with different combinations of open burners, flattops (not to be confused
with griddle units), and ring tops. Open burners and ring tops supply direct heat, which
is easy to change and control. Flattops provide indirect heat, which is more even and less
intense than direct heat. Foods that require long, slow cooking, such as stocks, are more
effectively cooked on a flattop. Small units known as candy stoves or stockpot ranges have
rings of gas jets or removable rings under a flattop, allowing for excellent heat control. Ovens
cook foods by surrounding them with hot air, a gentler and more even source of heat than the
direct heat of a burner.
Open-­burner range

This type of range has individual grate-­style burners that allow for

easy adjustment of heat.
Flattop range

This consists of a thick plate of cast iron or steel set over the heat source.

Flattops give relatively even and consistent heat but do not allow for quick adjustments of
temperature.
Ring-­top range

This is a flattop with plates that can be removed to widen the opening,

supplying more or less heat.
Induction cooktop

This relies on the magnetic attraction between the cooktop and

steel or cast iron in the pan to generate heat. The cooktop itself remains cool. Reaction
time is significantly faster than for traditional burners. Pans containing copper or
aluminum may not be used.
Convection oven

Fans force hot air to circulate around the food, cooking it evenly and

quickly. Some convection ovens have the capacity to introduce moisture.
Conventional/deck oven

The heat source is located on the bottom, underneath the

deck (floor) of the oven. Heat is conducted through the deck to the cavity. Conventional
ovens can be located below a range top or as separate shelves arranged one above
another. The latter are known as deck ovens, and the food is placed directly on the deck
instead of on a wire rack. Deck ovens normally consist of two to four decks, although
single-­deck models are available.
Combi oven

The combi oven works both as a steamer and as a convection oven. This

powerful cooking center can be used in steam mode, hot-­air convection mode, or heat/
steam (combi) mode.
Heating and steaming: It’s this dual heating/steaming function, the combi mode, that is
especially useful in a professional kitchen. Large volumes of vegetables can be steamed
gently, but quickly, to keep the nutrients and texture intact.
Roasting: While being gently steamed, the vegetables can be simultaneously roasted to
achieve the color and flavor benefits of dry cooking. To roast a large volume of vegetables,
the oven should be set at low humidity and high convection speed to quickly evaporate
moisture from the surface of the vegetables and to facilitate browning without overdrying
the vegetables.

chapter 4 • EQUIPMENT IDENTIFICATION | 63

Simmering: Because you can also simmer or stew vegetables when the combi oven is
set at low heat and high humidity, you can produce deep hotel pans of grains, legumes,
and other slow-­cooked items with great efficiency. Some units even allow for overnight
cooking with proper HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points).
Major Benefits of the Combi Oven

The combi oven is such an effective tool in the

large-­scale kitchen because it has several automated functions. It is designed to hold
food at lower, safe temperatures without overcooking or drying it out, which makes it
much easier to produce fresh, quality food at high volumes.

1

Its advanced computerized technology allows the chef to preset specific programs
for certain menu items.

2

Food can be cooked at a lower temperature to better preserve color, flavor, texture,
and nutrition. The lower temperature also preserves the ingredient’s moisture
content because less shrinkage takes place.

3

Some combi ovens have rolling racks, which makes it very easy to move freshly
cooked food to a blast chiller or walk-­in refrigerator.

4

The latest models of combi ovens self-­clean, making end-­of-­service even more
efficient.

Microwave oven

This oven uses electricity to generate microwave radiation, which

cooks or reheats foods very quickly. Some models double as convection ovens.

Griddles and Grills
Two other range/oven features, the griddle and the grill, are part of the traditional commercial
foodservice setup.
Griddle

Similar to a flattop range, a griddle has a heat source located beneath a

thick plate of metal, generally cast iron or steel. The food is cooked directly on the
griddle surface.
Grill/broiler/salamander

In a grill, the heat source is located below a rack; in a broiler

or salamander, the heat source is above. Some units have adjustable racks that allow the
food to be raised or lowered to control cooking speed. Some grills burn wood, charcoal,
or both, but units in restaurants are often either gas or electric fired, with ceramic “rocks”
that create a bed of coals to produce the effect of a charcoal grill. Broilers radiate an
intense heat from above and can be found as a setting in a gas or an electric oven. If the
broiler is contained as a separate unit, it is known as a salamander and is used primarily
to finish or glaze foods.

Smokers
A true smoker will treat foods with smoke and can be operated at either cool or hot
temperatures. Smokers generally have racks or hooks that allow foods to smoke evenly.

Refrigeration Equipment
Maintaining adequate refrigerated storage is crucial to any foodservice operation; therefore,
the menu and the storage must be evaluated and coordinated. All units should be maintained
properly, which means regular and thorough cleaning.

64 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

Walk-­in

This is the largest style of refrigeration unit and usually has shelves arranged

around the walls. It is possible to zone a walk-­in to maintain appropriate temperature
and humidity levels for storing various foods. Some walk-­ins are large enough to
accommodate rolling carts for additional storage. Some have pass-­through or reach-­in
doors to facilitate access to frequently required items. Walk-­ins may be situated in the
kitchen or outside the facility.
Reach-­in

A reach-­in may be a single unit or part of a bank of units, available in many

sizes. Units with pass-­through doors are especially helpful for the pantry area, where cold
items can be retrieved by the wait staff as needed.
On-­site refrigeration

Refrigerated drawers or undercounter reach-­ins allow ingredients

to be held on the line at the proper temperature.
Portable refrigeration

A refrigerated cart can be placed as needed in the kitchen.

Display refrigeration

Display cases are generally used in the dining room for desserts,

salads, or salad bars.

Grinding, Slicing, Mixing, and Puréeing Equipment Grinders, slicers,
and puréeing equipment all have the potential to be extremely dangerous. As these tools are
essential for a number of operations, all chefs should be able to use them with confidence.

CHAPTER 5

MEAT, POULTRY,
AND GAME
IDENTIFICATION
For most restaurants, the purchase,
preparation, and service of meats
is one of the most expensive areas
of the business—­but also one of the
most potentially profitable. In order
to get the most value out of the
meats purchased, it is important to
understand how to select the right
cut for a particular cooking method.

MEAT BASICS
The meat, poultry, and game cuts that a restaurant should buy will depend upon the nature
of the particular operation. A restaurant featuring predominantly à la minute preparations—­
especially one with a preponderance of grilled or sautéed items—­will need to purchase
extremely tender (and more expensive) cuts. A restaurant that uses a variety of techniques
may be able to use some less-tender cuts—­for example, the veal shank in a braise such as
osso buco.
Meats can be purchased in a number of forms and at varying degrees of readiness to
cook. The chef should consider several factors when deciding what type of meat to buy.
Storage capacity, the equipment required to prepare a menu item, the kitchen staff’s ability
to fabricate cuts, and the volume of meat required must all be taken into consideration.
Once this information is evaluated, the chef can determine whether it is more economical
to purchase large pieces, such as whole legs of veal, or prefabricated meats, such as veal
already cut into a top round, or precut scaloppini.
Meats should be checked for wholesomeness and freshness. Cut surfaces should appear
moist, but not shiny. The meat should have a good color, which varies by type as well as by
cut. The meat should also smell appealing. Packaged meats should arrive with the packaging
intact with no punctures or tears.
The tables accompanying the following sections contain key pieces of information about
beef, veal, pork, and lamb, adapted from The Meat Buyer’s Guide by the North American
Meat Processors Association (NAMP), including item numbers as assigned by the NAMP and
an average range in size for a cut. Appropriate cooking methods for various cuts have also
been included.

Storage
Meats, poultry, and game should be wrapped and stored under refrigeration. When possible,
they should be held in a separate unit, or at least in a separate part of the cooler. They should
always be placed on trays to prevent them from dripping onto other foods or the floor.
The chef should separate different kinds of meats; for example, poultry should not come into
contact with beef, or pork products into contact with any other meats. This will prevent cross
contamination.
Vacuum-packed meats can be stored directly in the package, as long as it has not been
punctured or ripped. Once unwrapped, meats should be rewrapped in air-permeable paper,
such as butcher’s paper, because airtight containers promote bacterial growth that could
result in spoilage or contamination.
Variety meats, poultry, and uncured pork products, which have short shelf lives, should be
cooked as soon as possible after they are received. Meat stored at the proper temperature
and under optimal conditions can be held for several days without noticeable loss of quality.
Meat can also be frozen for longer storage.
• Refrigerated: 28° to 32°F/−2° to 0°C
• Frozen: 0° to 20°F/−18° to −7°C

68 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

Inspection and Grading
Government inspection of all meats is mandatory. Inspections are required at various times:
at the slaughterhouse (antemortem) and again after butchering (postmortem). This is done
to ensure that the animal is free from disease and that the meat is wholesome and fit for
human consumption. Inspection is a service paid for by tax dollars.
Some states have relinquished the responsibility for inspecting meats to federal inspectors.
Those states that still administer their own inspections of meat must at least meet, if not
exceed, the accepted federal standards.
Quality grading, however, is not mandatory. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
has developed specific standards to assign grades to meats and trains graders. The packer
may, however, choose not to hire a USDA grader and may forgo grading in favor of the use of
an in-house brand name instead. The costs involved in grading meats are absorbed by the
individual meat packer, not the taxpayer, since this process is voluntary.
Depending upon the particular animal, the grader will consider overall carcass shape, ratio
of fat to lean, ratio of meat to bone, color, and marbling of lean flesh. The grade placed on
a particular carcass is then applied to all the cuts from that animal. In beef, only a small
percentage of meats produced is graded prime. Choice and select are more often available.
Grades lower than select are generally used for processed meat and are of no practical
importance to the restaurant (or retail) industry.
Some meats may also receive yield grades. This grade is of the greatest significance to
wholesalers. It indicates the amount of salable meat in relation to the total weight of the
carcass. Butchers refer to this as “cutability.” In other words, it is a measure of the yield of
edible meat from each pound of the carcass.

Market Forms of Meat
After slaughtering, inspection, and grading, the animal carcass is cut into manageable pieces.
Sides are prepared by making a cut down the length of the backbone. Each side is cut into
two pieces to make quarters, dividing the sides between specific vertebrae. Saddles are
made by cutting the animal across the belly, again at a specified point. The exact standards
for individual animal types govern where the carcass is to be divided.
The next step is to cut the animal into what are referred to as primal cuts. There are uniform
standards for beef, veal, pork, and lamb primals. These large cuts are then further broken
down into subprimals. Subprimals are generally trimmed and packed as foodservice, value
added, or HRI (Hotel, Restaurant, and Institution) cuts. There may be even more fabrication
or butchering done in order to prepare steaks, chops, roasts, or ground meat. These cuts are
referred to as portion control cuts.
The amount of butchering done in packing plants has increased over the past several years.
While it is still possible to purchase hanging meat, most operations will buy what is referred
to as boxed meat. This indicates that the meat has been fabricated to a specific point (primal,
subprimal, or retail cut), packed in Cryovac, boxed, and shipped for sale to purveyors,
butchers, chain retail outlets, and so forth.

chapter 5 • MEAT, POULTRY, AND GAME IDENTIFICATION | 69

Kosher Meats
Kosher meats are specially slaughtered, bled, and fabricated in order to comply with religious
dietary laws. In this country, only beef and veal forequarters, poultry, and some game
are customarily used for kosher preparations. Kosher meats are butchered from animals
slaughtered by a shohet, or by a specially trained rabbi. The animal must be killed with a
single stroke of a knife, then fully bled. All the veins and arteries must be removed from the
meat. This process would essentially mutilate the flesh of loins and legs of beef and veal;
therefore, these are generally not sold as kosher.

Offal
Offal can best be described as the edible by-products of a meat carcass. Examples include
organ meats such as the liver, kidney, heart, brain, tripe, certain glands, and intestinal tracts.
In addition, the cheeks, tail, and tongue are part of the offal category. Offal is generally
inexpensive but requires some skill to cook properly. Organ meats are composed of fibers
that are different from those of lean muscle. Membranes, blood vessels, and connective
tissues need to be removed from livers and kidneys. Organ meats, such as the liver and
kidneys, are high in iron, which translates into rich flavor. The tail has some meat and a lot of
collagen and is typically used for rich braises.
In many cultures, offal is considered a delicacy. Some offal is considered the epitome of high
cuisine. An example would be the fattened duck or goose liver known as foie gras. This meat
has a consistency that resembles butter and a distinctive flavor. Foie gras is an exception to
the general rule that organ meats are inexpensive and can command a high price. Another
exception to this rule is the sweetbread, or thymus gland, of veal. When properly prepared,
this soft-structured gland can be eaten with a fork. Sweetbreads are in high demand and
warrant a high cost.
Organ meats tend to be highly perishable and therefore must be used fresh, within a week
of slaughter, or purchased frozen. Be sure to keep frozen items below 32° and −4°F/0° and
−18°C to ensure the formation of small ice crystals and minimize damage.

BEEF
Beef is essential to the foodservice industry, especially in the United States. A significant
source of protein, beef is featured in an array of classic and contemporary dishes. This
expensive product demands special care and training. Utilizing as much of each cut to
maximize the yield is an important practice to follow.
Cattle used for the beef industry are typically steers (castrated males) over one year old
and heifers (female cows) not required for breeding. The older the bovine, the tougher the
meat. Specialty beef such as Kobe beef from Japan, Limousin beef from France, and Certified
Angus, natural, organic, and dry-aged beef from the United States are also available.
The eight grades of beef, in order of highest to lowest quality, are as follows: Prime, Choice,
Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter, and Canner. Prime is usually reserved for
restaurants and butcher shops.

VEAL
Veal is the flesh of a young calf, generally four to five months old. Because of its young,
delicately tender flesh, it is considered by some to be the finest meat available. Classical
preparations include, but are not limited to, osso buco, vitello tonnato, cordon bleu, veal
piccata, and veal scaloppine.
Fine veal calves are fed mother’s milk or formula. Milk-fed veal is up to twelve weeks old and
is believed to have the most tender meat. Formula-fed calves consume a special diet and are
the standard type of veal used today; this veal is up to four months old.
Veal should be selected by color; it should be light pink in color and tender. The five USDA
grades of veal, in order of highest to lowest quality, are Prime, Choice, Good, Standard, and
Utility. Because the overall ratio of meat to bone is less than a full-grown bovine, there are
proportionately fewer cuts of veal.

PORK
Pork, the meat of domesticated pigs, is among the most popular meat sold in the United
States. Typically high in fat, pigs have been specifically bred over many generations to
produce leaner cuts of meat. Pigs are commonly slaughtered under one year of age to ensure
a tender product.
Although quality grades are less frequently assigned to pork, when applied, the USDA grades,
in order of highest to lowest quality, are 1, 2, 3, 4, and Utility.
Because USDA grading is not required for pork and federal grading must be paid for, packers
will often use their own grading system. This does not necessarily mean that various cuts
of pork are not of good quality, for the grading systems used by major packers are clearly
defined and are generally reliable. In the tables that follow, BRT indicates boned, rolled, and
tied, and RTE signifies ready to eat.

LAMB AND MUTTON
Lamb is the tender meat produced by young, domesticated sheep. Its texture is a direct
result of what it consumes and the age at which it is slaughtered. The milk-fed varieties of
lamb are inclined to yield the most delicate meat. Once a lamb begins to eat grass, the flesh
loses some of its tenderness. However, most lamb produced in the United States is finished
on a grain diet and is six to seven months old. Lamb that is allowed to age over sixteen
months is known as mutton. Mutton is considered to have a more pronounced flavor and
texture than lamb. As with other varieties of meat, lamb becomes tougher as it ages.
Lamb tends to be fatty. Its unique flavor pairs nicely with intense seasonings and
accompaniments. The five grades of lamb, in order of highest to lowest quality, are Prime,
Choice, Good, Utility, and Cull.

VENISON AND FURRED GAME
Free-roaming and domesticated wild animals fall under the category of game. A variety of
game meats have become increasingly popular due in part to customer awareness of lower
fat and cholesterol content. Depending upon the area of the country, several types of furred
game are available.
Game meats are categorized into two segments: large and small. Venison is the most popular
large game, characterized by lean meat that is free from intramuscular fat, generally dark red
in color, and suitable for roasting, sautéing, and grilling. Though venison commonly refers to
deer, other members of the venison family include moose, elk, and reindeer. Buffalo and wild
boar are other popular large game.
The most common of the small game is rabbit. Rabbit has mild, lean, tender, and finetextured meat. A mature rabbit ranges from three to five pounds, and young rabbit is
generally two to three pounds. The loin is often sautéed or roasted, while legs are commonly
braised or stewed.
Commercial game meats are federally inspected. The quality of the flesh is a direct result of
age, diet, and the time of year that it was killed.

POULTRY
The word poultry refers to any domesticated bird used for human consumption. Once
reserved for special occasions, chicken and other poultry have become commonplace in
restaurants and homes. The subtle and familiar flavor of chicken lends itself well to a number
of different cooking methods. Considered very nutritious, poultry entrées are among the
most popular on most menus.
Similar to other meats, poultry must undergo a mandatory inspection for wholesomeness.
The grades of USDA A, B, or C depend on numerous factors, such as carcass shape and the
ratio of meat to bone. Once inspected, the birds are plucked, cleaned, chilled, and packaged.
They may be purchased whole or in parts. Poultry is classified by age. The younger the bird,
the more tender the flesh.

CHAPTER 6

FISH AND
SHELLFISH
IDENTIFICATION
Fish and shellfish were once plentiful and inexpensive;
however, due to overfishing and the development and
degradation of many coastal areas, demand has begun to
outstrip supply. These factors have caused many countries
to pass regulations limiting commercial fishing in specific
waters, as well as the rise of aquaculture (the farm raising
of fish), to ensure reliable sources. As the health benefits
of fish are increasingly becoming widely known, many
Americans who traditionally favored red meats both at home
and when they eat out are ordering fish entrées more often.

FISH BASICS
The increased value of seafood demands that a chef must be familiar with a wide variety of
fish and shellfish, and their sources; be able to select absolutely fresh fish and shellfish of the
best quality; and understand the best cooking method or methods to use in their preparation.
The first step in the selection process is assessing the purveyor or market. The fishmonger
should properly handle, ice, and display the fish and should be able to answer any questions
regarding the fish’s origin and its qualities: lean or oily, firm-textured or delicate, appropriate
for moist-heat method or able to withstand a grill’s heat.

Market Forms of Fish
Fish can be purchased fresh in the market forms described below, as well as in frozen,
smoked, pickled, or salted forms.
Whole fish

This is the fish as it was caught, completely intact. This is typically referred

to as “in the round.”
Drawn fish

The viscera (guts) are removed, but head, fins, and scales are still intact.

H & G (headed and gutted) or head-off drawn

The head and viscera (guts) are

removed, but scales and fins are still intact.
Dressed fish

The viscera (guts), gills, scales, and fins are removed. The head may or

may not be removed. Also known as pan-dressed, these fish are usually appropriate for a
single serving.
Steak

This is a portion-sized cross section cut from a dressed fish. Portion cuts from

the fillets of large fish, such as tuna and swordfish, are also commonly called steaks.
Fillet

This is a boneless piece of fish, removed from either side of the backbone. The

skin may or may not be removed before cooking. Purveyors often sell fillets “pin-bone in,”
so it is important to specify “pin-bone out” when ordering.
Tranche

A portion-sized slice of a fillet that is cut at a 45-degree angle to expose a

greater surface area. A tranche is generally cut from a large fillet, for example, salmon
or halibut.
Pavé A portion-sized square cut from a fillet. A pavé is generally cut from a large fillet,
for example, salmon, halibut, mahi mahi, or tuna.

Freshness Checks for Finfish
To ensure that fish are of the best quality, the chef should carefully inspect them, checking for
as many of the following signs of freshness and quality as possible:
• Fish should be received at a temperature of 40°F/4°C or less.
• The fish should have a good overall appearance (clear slime, no cuts or bruising, pliable
fins).
• The scales should adhere tightly to the fish.
• The flesh should respond to light pressure and not feel soft.
• The eyes should be clear, bright, and bulging.

84 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

• The gills should be bright pink to maroon in color, and if mucous is present, it should be
clear.
• There should be no “belly burn”—­evidence that the viscera (guts) were left in the fish too
long, resulting in bacteria and enzymes breaking down the flesh along the rib cage.
• The fish should have a clean, sweet, sea-like smell.

Storage
Under correct storage conditions, fish and shellfish can be held for several days without
losing any appreciable quality. Ideally, however, the chef should purchase only the amount of
fish needed for a day or two and should store it properly, as described below:

1

Always keep fish at a proper storage temperature and handle them as little as possible.
Finfish: 28° to 32°F/−2° to 0°C; smoked fish: 32°F/0°C; caviar: 28° to 32°F/−2° to 0°C.

2

Whole, drawn, H&G, and dressed fish may be rinsed at this point; scaling and fabricating
should be delayed until close to service time.

3

Place the fish on a bed of shaved or flaked ice in a perforated container (such as a hotel
pan with a draining pan), preferably stainless steel. The fish should be belly down, and
the belly cavity should be filled with shaved ice as well.

4

Cover with additional ice. Fish may be layered, if necessary, with shaved or flaked ice;
cubed ice can bruise the fish’s flesh. It also will not conform as closely to the fish. Shaved
or flaked ice makes a tighter seal around the entire fish. This prevents undue contact
with the air, slowing loss of quality and helping to extend safe storage life.

5

Set the perforated container in a second container. In this way, as the ice melts, the
water will drain away. If fish is allowed to sit in a pool of water, flavor and texture loss will
occur. The longer it sits, the greater the loss of quality.

6

Re-ice fish daily. Even when properly iced, fish will gradually lose some quality. To slow
this loss, skim the top layer of ice from the storage container, and replace it with
fresh ice.

Fish purchased as fillets or steaks should be stored in stainless-steel containers set on ice.
They should not be in direct contact with the ice, however, because as it melts, much of the
flavor and texture of the fish will be lost.
Frozen fish, including ice-glazed whole fish (repeatedly coated with water and frozen so
that the ice builds up in layers, coating the entire fish), individually quick frozen (IQF), and
frozen fillets (which are often treated with sodium tripolyphosphate [stp] to promote added
water retention) should be stored at −20° to 0°F/−29° to −18°C until ready to be thawed
and cooked.
Do not accept any frozen fish with white frost on its edges. This indicates freezer burn, the
result of improper packaging or thawing and refreezing of the product.

chapter 6 • FISH AND SHELLFISH IDENTIFICATION | 85

COMMON FISH TYPES
The skeletal structure of fish is a useful means of separating finfish into smaller groupings.
The three basic types of finfish are flat, round, and nonbony. Flatfish have a backbone that
runs through the center of the fish with two upper and two lower fillets, and both eyes on
the same side of the head. Round fish have a middle backbone with one fillet on either side,
and one eye on each side of the head. Nonbony fish have cartilage rather than bones. (See
diagrams on pages 87 and 88.)
Fish may also be categorized by their activity level: low, medium, or high. The more a fish
swims, the darker its flesh will be. Darker-fleshed fish have a higher oil content and, therefore,
a stronger flavor. When choosing the best cooking technique for a given fish, consider the oil
content of the flesh. Low- and high-activity fish have limited cooking methods, while mediumactivity fish are quite versatile. (See the tables on pages 87 to 90.)

Flat Fish
The characteristics of flat fish include the following: one pigmented and one nonpigmented
side; either right- or left-eyed; continuous dorsal and anal fins that stop before the caudal fin.

SHELLFISH
Shellfish are aquatic animals protected by some sort of carapace (shell). Based on skeletal
structure, they are segmented into four distinct categories: univalves (single-shelled
mollusks), bivalves (mollusks with two shells joined by a hinge), crustaceans (jointed
exterior skeletons or shells), and cephalopods (mollusks with tentacles attached directly to
the head).

Market Forms
Shellfish are available fresh and frozen in various forms. Fresh shellfish are available live,
shucked as tails, cocktail claws, and legs and claws. Frozen shellfish are also available
shucked as tails, cocktail claws, and legs and claws.
Shucking is the removal of a mollusk’s meat from the shell; the shucked market form is sold
as meat only, along with natural juices known as liquor. Mollusks such as oysters, clams, and
mussels may be available shucked. Scallops are nearly always sold shucked, although there
is a growing market for scallops that are live and on the half-shell with roe.

Quality Indicators
When purchasing live shellfish, look for signs of movement. Lobsters and crabs should move
about. Clams, mussels, and oysters should be tightly closed, but as they age, they will begin
to open, and should close when touched. Any shells that do not snap shut when tapped
should be discarded; this means that the fish are dead. Molluskan shellfish should have a
sweet, sea-like aroma.

92 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

Storage
Crabs, lobsters, and other live shellfish should be packed in seaweed or damp paper upon
delivery. If a lobster tank is not available, they can be stored directly in their shipping
containers or in perforated pans at 39° to 45°F/4° to 7°C until they are to be prepared. Do not
allow lobsters or crabs to come into direct contact with fresh water, as it will kill them.
Clams, mussels, and oysters purchased in the shell should be stored in the bag in which
they were delivered or in perforated pans. They should not be iced, but should be stored at a
temperature between 35° and 40°F/2° and 4°C. The bag should be closed tightly and lightly
weighted to keep the shellfish from opening.

the information they need to take full advantage of the abundance
of fresh produce now available, including tips on availability,
determination of quality, proper storage, and culinary uses.

GENERAL GUIDELINES
Selection
Fruits, vegetables, and herbs should be in good condition, though what constitutes a
favorable appearance varies from one item to another. In general, fruits and vegetables
should be free of bruises, mold, brown or soft spots, and pest damage; they should have
colors and textures appropriate to their type; and any attached leaves should not be wilted.
Fruits should be plump, not shriveled. Specific information on particular types of produce is
given in the sections below.

Production Methods
Foodservice operations wield purchasing power that can be used to support or discourage
specific agricultural practices. You may wish to consider several agricultural production and
treatment methods when purchasing ingredients.
Agricultural biotechnology includes a multitude of scientific techniques that are used to
create, improve, or modify plants. For hundreds of years, scientists have improved plants
for human benefit using conventional techniques such as selective breeding. However,
conventional breeding methods can be time consuming and inaccurate. Through genetic
engineering, scientists are now able to isolate genes for a desirable trait and transfer them to
other organisms, resulting in genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that, for example, have
higher resistance to disease.
Irradiation is a food safety technology used to kill pathogenic organisms and extend shelf
life. Similar to the pasteurization of milk and pressure processing of canned goods, treating
foods with ionizing radiation (also known as cold pasteurization) can kill bacteria that might
otherwise cause food-­borne illness.
Sustainable agriculture pertains to agricultural production and distribution systems that
focus on providing a profitable farm income while promoting environmental stewardship.
Key practices include renewing and protecting soil fertility and the natural resource
base; improving the use of on-­farm resources; and minimizing the use of nonrenewable
resources. Sustainable farming strives to promote opportunities in family farming and farm
communities. Sustainable practices include implementing systems to stem soil erosion and
methods such as integrated pest management and field terracing.
Organic food is produced without the use of most conventional pesticides, synthetic
fertilizers, sewage sludge, fertilizer, bioengineering, or ionizing radiation. In order for a
product to be labeled “organic,” a government-­approved certifier must inspect where the
food is grown and processed to ensure that USDA organic standards are adhered to.
Hydroponic crops are grown in nutrient-­enriched water rather than soil. Hydroponic growing
takes place indoors under regulated temperature and light, so any growing season may be
duplicated. Today, hydroponically grown lettuces, spinach, herbs, and tomatoes are all readily
available. Although they have the advantage of being easy to clean, these products may have
a less pronounced flavor than fruits and vegetables grown in the soil.

Availability and Seasonality
Prior to the increase in agricultural production and distribution technology, chefs were
limited to locally grown seasonal fruits and vegetables. Though food establishments are
no longer bound to buy local produce, it is still a favorable practice if and when possible. It
is important to support the local growers. Moreover, so-­called boutique farmers may have
specialty produce (such as wild lettuces, golden beets, and yellow tomatoes) that is not
available through large commercial purveyors. Another advantage to buying locally is that
the flavor and condition of the foods are often superior; locally grown sweet corn, apricots,
peaches, and strawberries that have not been shipped are just a few examples. Conversely,
there are items that ship particularly well. Examples include asparagus, head lettuces,
broccoli, apples, and citrus fruits.

Storage
Once the produce has been received, following certain storage guidelines can ensure that its
quality remains high. Most foodservice establishments store produce for no more than three
or four days, although length of storage depends on the business’s volume, the available
storage facilities, and delivery frequency. It is ideal to let the purveyor handle the produce as
long as possible, to help ensure that you use the freshest product possible and not overload
your valuable storage space.
With a few exceptions (bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, and dry onions), ripe fruits and
vegetables should be refrigerated. Unless otherwise specified, produce should be kept at a
temperature of 40° to 45°F/4° to 7°C, with a relative humidity of 80 to 90 percent. The ideal
situation is to have a separate walk-­in or reach-­in refrigerator for fruits and vegetables.
Most fruits and vegetables should be kept dry, because excess moisture can promote
spoilage. Therefore, most produce should not be peeled, washed, or trimmed until just
before use. The outer leaves of lettuce, for example, should be left intact; carrots should
remain unpeeled. The exceptions to this rule are the leafy tops on root vegetables such as
beets, turnips, carrots, and radishes. They should be removed and either discarded or used
immediately, because even after harvesting, the leaves absorb nutrients from the root and
increase moisture loss.
Fruits and vegetables that need further ripening, notably peaches and avocados, should be
stored at room temperature, 65° to 70°F/18° to 21°C. Once the produce is ripe, it should be
refrigerated so that it does not become overripe.
Certain fruits, including apples, bananas, and melons, emit high amounts of ethylene gas as
they sit in storage. Ethylene gas can accelerate ripening in unripe fruits but can also promote
spoilage in fruits and vegetables that are already ripe. For this reason, unless they are being
used deliberately as a ripening agent, high ethylene-­producing fruits should be stored
separately. When separate storage space is unavailable, place ethylene-­producing fruits in
sealed containers.
Some fruits and vegetables, including onions, garlic, lemons, and melons, give off odors that
can permeate other foods. Dairy products are particularly susceptible to odor absorption and
should always be stored away from fruits and vegetables. Certain fruits, such as apples and
cherries, also absorb odors. They too should be well wrapped or stored separately.

chapter 7 • FRUIT, VEGETABLE, AND FRESH HERB IDENTIFICATION | 99

Many fruits and vegetables begin to deteriorate after three or four days. Although citrus
fruits, most root vegetables, and hard squashes have a longer storage life, most restaurants
do not hold even these items for more than two to three weeks.

FRUITS
Fruits are the ovaries that surround or contain the seeds of plants. Customarily used in sweet
dishes, fruits are also excellent with savory items, such as potato latkes and grilled pork
chops. Fruit is wonderful served alone as a refreshing breakfast or the finale to a meal. Dried
fruits find their way into compotes, stuffings, and sauces.

VEGETABLES
Vegetables are the roots, tubers, stems, leaves, leaf stalks, seeds, seedpods, and flower heads
of plants that may be safely eaten. Vegetables commonly include a number of foods that are
botanically classified as fruits, such as tomatoes. Their culinary application is the guiding
principle for placing them in this section rather than the previous one.

HERBS
Herbs are the leaves of aromatic plants, used primarily to add flavor to foods. Aroma is a
good indicator of quality in both fresh and dried herbs. They should have even color, healthy
looking leaves and stems, and no wilting, brown spots, sunburn, or pest damage.
Fresh herbs should be minced or cut in chiffonade as close to service time as possible. They
are usually added to a dish toward the end of the cooking time. For uncooked preparations,
fresh herbs should be added well in advance of serving.
In general, herbs should be stored loosely wrapped in damp paper towels and refrigerated. If
desired, place the wrapped herbs in plastic bags to help retain moisture and reduce wilting
and discoloration of leaves. It is a good idea to label the herbs, so they are easy to locate.

APPLES
Apples are perhaps America’s favorite fruit. Apples range in color from yellow to green to red,
and colors in between. Different varieties of apples have particular characteristics. Some are
best eaten out of hand, others are considered best for pies and baking, and still others are
selected for their ability to cook down into a rich, smooth purée for applesauce. For cider, a
blend of apples is usually chosen, to give the finished drink a full, well-­balanced flavor.
Select firm apples that have a smooth skin with no bruising, though rough brown spots are
acceptable. Apples can be held in climate-­controlled cold storage for many months without
significant loss of quality. Dried apples, prepared applesauce, apple juice (bottled or frozen
concentrate), cider, spiced or plain pie fillings, and a host of other prepared items made from
apples can also be purchased.

100 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

The flesh of many apples will begin to turn brown once they are cut open and come in contact
with air. Dousing them in acidulated water (water with a little lemon juice) will help prevent
browning but may not be desirable if a pure apple taste is important. The following table
covers a selection of apple varieties.

BERRIES
Berries tend to be highly perishable (with the exception of cranberries) and are susceptible
to bruising, molding, and overripening in fairly short order. Inspect all berries and their
packaging carefully before you accept them. Juice-­stained cartons or juice leaking through
the carton is a clear indication that the fruit has been mishandled or is old. Once berries
begin to turn moldy, the entire batch goes bad quickly.
When fresh berries are out of season, IQF (individually quick frozen) berries are often a
perfectly fine substitute. Dried berries are a delicious addition to winter fruit compotes,
stuffings, or baked goods. The following table covers a selection of berry varieties.

CITRUS FRUITS
Citrus fruits are characterized by extremely juicy, segmented flesh, and skins that contain
aromatic oils. Grapefruits, lemons, limes, and oranges are the most common citrus fruits.
They range dramatically in size, color, and flavor.
Select citrus that is firm and heavy in relation to its size, with no soft spots. Green hues or
rough brown spots generally do not affect the flavor or texture of the fruit. For oranges, it
is not necessary to select fruits with brightly colored skins, as they are often dyed. When
selecting grapefruits, lemons, and limes, on the other hand, look for brightly colored fruits with
a finely textured skin. Citrus can be stored at room temperature for a short time, but should
be refrigerated if being held for an extended period. Citrus juice is available canned, bottled,
frozen, and as frozen concentrate. The table that follows covers a selection of citrus varieties.

GRAPES
Technically, grapes are berries, but because they include so many varieties and have so many
different uses, they are usually grouped separately. There are varieties of grapes, both with
seeds and seedless, available for both eating and wine making.
Grapes vary greatly in color from pale green to deep purple. Choose grapes that are plump
and juicy, with smooth skins that have a pale gray film (known as bloom). Grapes should be
firmly attached to their green stems. There are varieties of grapes with skin that easily slips
off the fruit (Concord), and other varieties in which the skin remains firmly intact (Thompson
seedless). Grapes are also dried to make raisins and currants.
Store grapes, unwashed, in the refrigerator. Grapes should be thoroughly washed and blotted
dry just prior to being eaten. Grapes are best served at room temperature. The following table
covers a selection of grape varieties.
Grapes from California will come into season in late May for some red grapes, and June or
July for Thompson, and last into early December. Grapes in the eastern United States have a
shorter season, becoming available in August and then gone by November. Imported grapes
are generally available year-­round; almost all imported grapes come from Mexico and Chile.

MELONS
These succulent, fragrant fruits are members of the gourd family, as are squashes and
cucumbers. They come in many varieties and range from the size of an orange to that of a
watermelon. The two major categories of melons are the muskmelon and the watermelon.
There are two kinds of muskmelons commonly available, the cantaloupe type and the
honeydew type.
Selecting melons and determining ripeness depends greatly on the type. When selecting the
cantaloupe-­type muskmelons, look for heavy fruits with a “full slip”—­that is, a clean break
from the stem—­signifying that the melon ripened on the vine. When ripe, all muskmelons
should become slightly soft at the stem end and give off a sweet scent. Muskmelons must be
seeded before they are eaten.
The mildly flavored watermelon varieties should be symmetrical. Avoid those with flat sides,
soft spots, or damaged rinds. A ripe watermelon should have good ground color, without
any white on the underside. Unripe melons should be stored in a cool, dark place; ripe or cut
melon should be kept under refrigeration. The following table covers a selection of melon
varieties.

PEARS
This fruit comes in many varieties, ranging from round to bell shaped, spicy to sweet, and
yellow to red. Unlike many other fruits, pears ripen after they are picked. When pears are
not fully ripened, they can have granules in the flesh known as stone cells, which give them
an unpleasant sandy or gritty texture. This is a positive characteristic because ripe pears
are extremely fragile and otherwise would not ship well. When choosing pears, look for fruit
that is mature and aromatic, with no scuffing, bruises, pits, or shriveling in the skin or neck.
Keep unripe pears at room temperature, but refrigerate them once they are ripe because
the colder temperatures will inhibit the ripening process. Like apples, cut pears turn brown
once they are exposed to the air. Storing them in acidulated water will help prevent browning,
but may alter the true flavor of the pear. The best uses for several varieties are given in the
following table.

STONE FRUITS
Peaches, nectarines, apricots, plums, and cherries are often referred to as stone fruits
because they have one large central pit (stone). These fruits are usually divided into either
“freestone” or “clingstone” varieties. In a freestone fruit, as their name suggests, the seed,
or stone, more easily separates itself from the flesh, whereas the clingstone pit more tightly
adheres to the flesh of the fruit. Because of their ease of use, freestone varieties are more
frequently utilized for cooking purposes that require the removal of the stone. In addition
to their fresh form, these fruits are also commonly available canned, frozen, and dried.
Many countries produce fruit brandies, wines, and cordials flavored with peaches, cherries,
and plums.
Stone fruits are generally only
available in the summer months,
except for some imports from South
America. They will soften once
picked but not gain any sweetness.
Therefore, the fruit generally found
in the marketplace will have been
picked while still very firm or hard to
facilitate shipping without incurring
damage to the soft, fully ripened fruit.
Color is the best indicator of a fruit
that is fully matured before picking;
look for full and vibrantly colored fruit.
There should also be a full, sweet
aroma indicative of the flavor when
the fruit is softened. The following
table covers a selection of stone fruit
varieties.

SOFT-­SHELL SQUASH, CUCUMBER,
AND EGGPLANT
Soft-­shell squash, cucumber, and eggplant are all vegetables that are picked when they are
immature to ensure a delicate flesh, tender seeds, and thin skins. Soft-­shell squash and
eggplant varieties cook rather quickly, while cucumbers are most often eaten raw. Select
soft-­shell squashes, eggplants, and cucumbers that are on the smaller side, firm, brightly
colored, and without bruising. These varieties should all be refrigerated.

LETTUCE
Each of the thousands of lettuce varieties can be classified into one of the following
categories: butterhead, crisphead, romaine, or leaf. Select lettuce that is crisp, never wilted or
bruised. Lettuce should not be washed, cut, or torn until just before service. Store lettuce in
the refrigerator, covered loosely with damp paper towels.
As with most greens, it is very important to thoroughly wash lettuce, as dirt and grit tend to
hide between the leaves. Never submerge lettuce in water for an extended amount of time,
and be sure that it is dried well after washing (a salad spinner is great for this). The following
table covers several varieties of lettuce.

in the refrigerator.

MUSHROOMS
Mushrooms are a fungus that exists in thousands of varieties. Cultivated mushrooms,
commonly available today, include the familiar white mushroom and varieties such as
portobello, cremini, shiitake, and oyster mushrooms. Wild mushrooms, prized for their
concentrated, earthy flavor, include the cèpe (porcini), chanterelle, morel, and the truffle.
Knowing your purveyor is important when you have wild mushrooms on the menu, as
many varieties are poisonous. Some varieties of mushrooms are available canned, frozen,
and dried.
Select mushrooms that are firm, without blemishes or breaks. If using varieties such as
the white or cremini, the caps should be tightly closed, as opened gills are a sign of age.
Conversely, when selecting portobellos—­a mature cremini—­it is desirable for the gills to be
open, signifying a concentration of flavor. Mushrooms that are to be cooked whole should be
of equal size so that they cook evenly.

116 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

Mushrooms should be stored in the refrigerator, in a single layer, covered with damp
paper towels. When you want to use them, wipe mushrooms with a damp paper towel, or
very quickly rinse them in cold water and drain immediately. Mushrooms should never be
submerged in water, since they absorb it like a sponge and will become mushy. See the
following table for information on varieties of mushrooms.

ONION FAMILY
Onions, invaluable to any kitchen, belong to the lily family. They fall into two main categories,
reflecting the state in which they are used: dry (cured) and green (fresh). Green onions
include scallions, leeks, and ramps. Dry onions are categorized by size and color. They can
range in size from pearl to Spanish, and from white to yellow to red in color.
Garlic, shallots, and onions (green and dry) all share a pungent flavor and aroma. Dry onions
make up half of the most fundamental aromatic combination, mirepoix. Green onions,
whether cooked (leeks) or raw (scallions), impart a sweetly subtle onion flavor. Shallots and
garlic are the flavoring agents in innumerable preparations.
Select dry onions, garlic, and shallots that are heavy for their size and have tight-­fitting, dry,
papery skins. Green onions should be green with white bottoms. They should be crisp, not
wilted. Dry onions, shallots, and garlic should be stored in a relatively cool, dry area of the
kitchen in the bags or boxes in which they are received. Green onions should be refrigerated
and must be thoroughly washed before they are used (leeks tend to have dirt between
each layer).
Chives are also a member of the onion family, though their main culinary application is
similar to that of fresh herbs. See the following table for more information on onions.

PEPPERS
There are two basic types of peppers: sweet peppers and chiles. Sweet peppers are
sometimes called bell peppers because of their shape. Sweet peppers of various colors have
similar flavors, though red and yellow varieties tend to be sweeter.
Chiles, an important ingredient in many cuisines, are available in various sizes, colors, and
levels of heat. Capsaicin is the compound that gives a chile its heat, and it is most potent in
the white ribs inside the pepper. Generally, the hotter chiles are smaller in size. It is imperative
to take precautions when handling chiles; wear gloves, wash cutting surfaces and knives, and
avoid contact with sensitive tissue such as the eyes.
Chiles are available fresh, canned, dried (whole, flaked, and ground), and smoked. Frequently,
dried and/or smoked chiles are given a name different than their fresh counterpart (e.g.,
smoked jalapeños are called chipotles).
When selecting both categories, look for firm, heavy peppers, with tight, glossy skin, without
puckering or wrinkling. The flesh should be relatively thick and crisp.

POD AND SEED VEGETABLES
This group includes fresh legumes (peas, beans, and bean sprouts), as well as corn and
okra. All varieties are best eaten young, when they are at their sweetest and most tender. If
possible, purchase pod and seed vegetables from local growers to minimize the time between
picking and serving. This is especially important with peas and corn.
Some fresh peas and beans are eaten whole, when the pods are still fleshy and tender—­
for example, sugar snap peas, snow peas, green beans, and wax beans. In other cases, the
peas or beans (such as limas, scarlet runners, and black-­eyed peas) are removed from their
inedible pods. Select vegetables that are crisp, brightly colored, and free of discoloration.
Peas, beans, and corn are also available dried.

Select tubers and rhizomes that are firm and the appropriate size and shape to their type. To
retain quality, tubers should be stored dry and unpeeled, away from excess heat and light, in
a well-­ventilated area. When exposed to moisture or heat, tubers begin to sprout and wrinkle.
The tuberous potato includes sweet potatoes/yams for culinary purposes (though of
another botanical classification). Though potatoes are remarkably versatile in their cooking
media, there are types that work best for each cooking method. Potatoes are separated into
categories based on starch content, and subsequently divided according to size (A, B, and C)
and skin color (white, red, yellow, and purple). Size A potatoes range from 1 7/8 to 2 1/4 inches;
size B range from 1 1/2 to 2 1/4 inches; and size C must be less than 1 1/4 inches. New potatoes
are those of any color that are recently harvested and thin-­skinned. Most size C potatoes are
marketed as creamer potatoes.

SHOOTS AND STALKS
This family consists of plants that produce shoots and stalks used as vegetables. Artichokes
(thistle-­like plants, members of the aster family), asparagus (another member of the lily
family), celery, fennel, and fiddleheads (part of the growth cycle of a fern) are examples. The
stalks should be firm, fleshy, and full, with no evidence of browning or wilting. Store these
vegetables in the refrigerator, and wash just prior to cooking them.

TOMATOES
This universal vegetable is actually a fruit. It is grown in hundreds of varieties, in colors from
green to yellow to bright red to purple. Basic types include small, round cherry tomatoes;
oblong plum tomatoes; and large standard tomatoes. All are available in various colors.
All have smooth, shiny skin, juicy flesh, and small, edible seeds. Most tomatoes grown
commercially are picked unripe and allowed to ripen in transit, though many chefs prefer
to find locally grown varieties that are ripened on the vine. There has been a recent surge in
demand for the heirloom species, such as the Cherokee Purple and Green Zebra.
Select brightly colored tomatoes, free of soft spots and blemishes. They should be heavy for
their size, but not overly firm. Tomatoes should not be refrigerated because the cold makes
the texture mushy, seizes the flavor, and halts ripening.
Tomatoes may be purchased in numerous forms, including sun-­dried and canned purée,
paste, and diced. The following table covers several varieties of tomatoes, including their
relative, the tomatillo.

CHAPTER 8

DAIRY AND EGG
PURCHASING AND
IDENTIFICATION
Concentrated sources of many nutrients, dairy products
and eggs can be found on almost any menu, both on their
own and as key ingredients in many preparations. Béchamel
sauce, for example, has a milk base. Cream, crème fraîche,
sour cream, and yogurt are used to prepare salad dressings
and many baked goods. Butter is used as a chief ingredient
in numerous baked goods and as a cooking fat. Cheese
may be served as a separate course with fruit, or as part
of another dish. Eggs appear on their own as well as in
breakfast dishes, dessert soufflés, and numerous sauces.

PURCHASING AND STORAGE
Dairy products and eggs are highly perishable; for these reasons, careful purchasing and
storage procedures are extremely important.
Milk and cream containers are customarily dated to indicate how long the contents
will remain fresh. The freshness periods vary between containers; therefore, to avoid
contamination, milk and cream from different containers should never be combined.
Unfortunately, detecting spoilage by simply smelling or tasting unheated milk is often
impossible. When used in hot dishes, milk or cream should be brought to a boil before adding
it to other ingredients. If the milk curdles, it should not be used.
When considering storage arrangements for dairy products, flavor transfer is a particular
concern. Milk, cream, and butter should be stored away from foods with strong odors, such
as onions. Cheeses should be carefully wrapped to maintain moistness, and to prevent flavor
transfer to and from other foods.
Eggs should be refrigerated and the stock rotated to ensure that only fresh, wholesome eggs
are served. All eggs should be inspected carefully upon delivery, making sure that shells are
clean and free of cracks. Eggs with broken shells should be discarded because of the high risk
of contamination.

DAIRY PRODUCTS
Milk
Milk is a key ingredient in most kitchens, whether it is served as a beverage or used as a
component in various dishes. U.S. federal regulations govern how milk is produced and
sold to ensure that it is clean and safe to consume. Most milk sold in the United States has
been pasteurized. In pasteurization, the milk is heated to 145°F/63°C for 30 minutes or
to 161°F/72°C for 15 seconds, in order to kill bacteria or other organisms that could cause
infection or contamination. Milk products with a higher percentage of milk fat than whole
milk are heated either to 150°F/66°C for 30 minutes or to 166°F/74°C for 30 seconds for
ultrapasteurization.
The date stamped on milk and cream cartons can be seven, ten, or sixteen days from the
point of pasteurization. It is an indicator of how long the unopened product will remain fresh
and wholesome, assuming that it has been properly stored and handled.
Generally, milk is homogenized, which means that it has been forced through an ultrafine
mesh at high pressure to break up the fat globules it contains. This fat is then dispersed
evenly throughout the milk, preventing it from rising to the surface. Milk may also be fortified
with vitamins A and D. Low-fat and skim milk are almost always fortified, because removing
the fat also removes fat-soluble vitamins.
State and local government standards for milk are fairly consistent. Milk products are
carefully inspected before and after processing. Farms and animals (cows, sheep, and goats)
are also inspected, to ensure that sanitary conditions are upheld. Milk that has been properly
produced and processed is labeled Grade A.

134 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

Milk comes in various forms and is classified according to its percentage of fat and milk
solids. The table below describes available forms of milk and cream and their common
culinary uses.

Cream
Milk, as it comes from the cow, goat, or sheep, contains a certain percentage of fat known as
milk fat or butterfat. Originally, milk was allowed to settle long enough for the cream, which
is lighter than the milk, to rise to the surface. Today, a centrifuge is used to spin the milk. The
cream is driven to the center, where it can be easily drawn off, leaving the milk behind.
Cream, like milk, is homogenized and pasteurized, and may also be stabilized to help extend
shelf life. Some chefs prefer cream that has not been stabilized or ultrapasteurized, because
they believe it will whip to a greater volume. Three forms of cream are used in most kitchens:
heavy cream, whipping cream, and light cream. Half-and-half (a combination of whole milk
and cream) does not contain enough milk fat to be considered a true cream; its milk fat
content is approximately 10.5 percent. See the table below.

* The fat percentages given here are minimums required by FDA labeling regulations. Some products, such as heavy cream, may contain a higher
percentage of milk fat.

chapter 8 • DAIRY AND EGG PURCHASING AND IDENTIFICATION | 135

Ice Cream
In order to meet government standards of identity, any product labeled as ice cream must
contain a certain amount of milk fat. For vanilla, it is no less than 10 percent. For any other
flavor, the requirement is 8 percent. Stabilizers can make up no more than 2 percent of the
ice cream. Frozen dairy foods that contain less fat must be labeled as ice milk. Premium ice
cream may contain several times more fat than the minimum required by these standards.
The richest ice creams have a custard base (a mixture of cream and/or milk and eggs), which
gives them a rich, smooth texture.
When ice cream melts at room temperature there should be no separation. The appearance
of “weeping” in melting ice cream indicates an excessive amount of stabilizers.
Other frozen desserts similar to ice cream include gelato, sherbet, sorbet, frozen yogurt, and
frozen desserts made with soy or rice milk. Gelato is Italian for “ice cream”; though similar,
gelato contains less air than American ice cream, giving it a denser, creamier texture. Sherbet
does not contain cream, so it is far lower in butterfat than ice cream; however, it does contain
a relatively high percentage of sugar in order to achieve the correct texture and consistency
when frozen. Some sherbets contain a percentage of either eggs or milk, or both. Although
the word “sherbet” is the closest English translation of the French word sorbet, sorbets are
commonly understood to contain no milk.
Frozen yogurt and soy and rice milk frozen desserts often contain stabilizers. They may be
lower in total fat than ice cream, or even fat-free, but some brands are still high in calories
because of a high sugar content.
Test a variety of these products to determine which brands offer the best quality for the
best price.

Butter
Anyone who has accidentally overwhipped cream has been well on the way to producing
butter. Historically, butter was churned by hand. Today, it is made mechanically by highspeed mixing of cream that contains between 30 and 45 percent milk fat. Eventually, the milk
fat clumps together, separating out into a solid mass, which is butter; the fluid that remains is
referred to as buttermilk (most buttermilk sold today, however, is nonfat milk that has been
cultured).
The best-quality butter has a sweet flavor, similar to very fresh heavy cream. If salt has been
added, it should be barely detectable. The color of butter will vary depending upon the breed
of cow and time of year, but it is usually a pale yellow.
The designation sweet butter indicates only that the butter is made from sweet cream (as
opposed to sour). If unsalted butter is desired, be sure that the word unsalted appears on
the package.
Salted butter may contain a maximum of 2 percent salt. The salt can aid in extending butter’s
shelf life, but can also mask a slightly “old” flavor or aroma. Old butter will take on a very faint
cheese flavor and aroma, especially when heated. As it continues to deteriorate, the flavor
and aroma can become quite pronounced and extremely unpleasant, much like sour or
curdled milk.

136 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

The best-quality butter, labeled Grade AA, is made from sweet cream and has the best flavor,
color, aroma, and texture. Grade A butter also is of excellent quality. Both grades AA and
A contain a minimum of 80 percent fat. Grade B may have a slightly acidic taste, as it is made
from sour cream.

FERMENTED AND CULTURED
MILK PRODUCTS
Yogurt, sour cream, crème fraîche, and buttermilk are all produced by inoculating milk or
cream with a bacterial strain that causes fermentation to begin. The fermentation process
thickens the milk and gives it a pleasantly sour flavor.
Yogurt is made by introducing the proper culture into milk (whole, low-fat, or nonfat may be
used). Available in a variety of container sizes, yogurt can be purchased plain or flavored with
different fruits, honey, coffee, or other ingredients.
Sour cream is a cultured sweet cream that contains about 18 percent milk fat. It comes in
containers of various sizes, beginning with a half pint. Low-fat and nonfat versions of sour
cream are available.
Crème fraîche is similar to sour cream but has a slightly more rounded flavor, with less
bite. It is often preferable in cooking because it tends to curdle less readily than sour cream
when used in hot dishes. This product is made from heavy cream with a butterfat content of
approximately 30 percent. The high butterfat content helps account for its higher cost.
Buttermilk, strictly speaking, is the by-product of churned butter. Most buttermilk sold today
is actually nonfat or reduced-fat milk to which a bacterial strain has been added. Usually sold
in pints or quarts, buttermilk is also available as a dried powder for baking uses.
Kefir is a fermented milk drink made by inoculating milk with kefir grains, which are
composed of a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY). These kefir grains initiate
the fermentation process, converting the lactose (milk sugar) in the milk into lactic acid,
ethanol (alcohol), and carbon dioxide.
The fermentation process gives kefir its characteristic tangy taste and effervescence. The
resulting beverage is a creamy, slightly fizzy, and probiotic-rich drink, often likened to a
drinkable yogurt.

Cheese
The variety of cheeses produced throughout the world is extensive, ranging from mild fresh
cheeses (pot cheese or cottage cheese) to strongly flavored blue-veined cheeses (Roquefort
or Gorgonzola) and hard grating cheeses (Parmigiano-Reggiano or dry Monterey Jack).
Some cheeses are excellent for cooking, while others are best served on their own.
The name of a cheese can be derived from place of origin, manufacturing process, or type of
milk or ingredient. Pecorino cheeses are an excellent illustration of how a cheese is named.
Pecorino denotes that the cheese is made of sheep’s milk; Pecorino Romano and Pecorino
Mugello are sheep’s milk cheeses from nearby Rome and Mugello, respectively.

chapter 8 • DAIRY AND EGG PURCHASING AND IDENTIFICATION | 137

Most cheeses are made through the following procedure: Milk is combined with the
appropriate starter (either rennet, which contains an enzyme, or an acid such as tartaric
acid or lemon juice), causing the milk solids to coagulate into curds or causing the creation
of acid, trace enzymes, and chemicals, which then cause curding. (The remaining liquid is
known as the whey.) Some cheeses are made with added acid, such as lemon juice. The
curds are then processed in various ways, depending on the type of cheese desired. They
may be drained and used immediately, as fresh cheese, or they may be pressed, shaped,
inoculated with a special mold, and aged.
Traditionally made cheeses are considered “living” in much the same way that wine is. The
cheese will continue to develop or age to maturity (ripening), and finally spoil (overripening).
Processed or pasteurized cheeses and cheese foods, on the other hand, do not ripen and
their character will not change.
Cheese is made from a variety of different milks—­cow’s milk, goat’s milk, sheep’s milk, and
even water buffalo’s milk. The type of milk used will help to determine the cheese’s ultimate
flavor and texture. Cheeses may be grouped according to the type of milk from which they
are made, or by texture, age, or ripening process. This book categorizes cheese as fresh
cheeses; soft/rind-ripened cheeses; semisoft cheeses; firm cheeses; hard cheeses; and blueveined cheeses. See the tables on pages 138 to 143.

Fresh Cheeses These cheeses are moist and very soft. They have a flavor that is
generally termed mild, but fresh cheese made from goat’s or sheep’s milk may be slightly
tangy and strong. Fresh cheeses are unripened, high in moisture, and generally have a fresh,
creamy, clean flavor. They are typically the most perishable of cheeses and are sometimes
held in brines.

138 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

Soft/Rind-Ripened Cheese Soft/rind-ripened cheeses usually have a surface
mold. This soft, velvety skin is edible, though some people find it too strong to enjoy. Many
of these cheeses have a washed rind. These are periodically washed with a liquid such as
beer, cider, wine, or brandy during ripening. The cheese ripens from the outside to the center.
When fully ripe, most soft cheeses should bulge (at room temperature) when cut, and have
a full flavor. These cheeses are typically sprayed or dusted with a mold and then allowed
to ripen. Soft ripened cheeses are available with varying degrees of richness. For example,
single, double, and triple cream cheeses have 50, 60, and 70 percent butterfat, respectively.

EGGS
Eggs are one of the kitchen’s most important items. From mayonnaise to meringues, soups
to sauces, appetizers to desserts, they are prominent on any menu. The ability to select the
right egg for a particular dish (shell egg, yolks only, whites only, or pasteurized eggs) is critical
to its success. To learn more about cooking eggs, see Chapter 27.

Grading, Sizes, and Forms
Eggs are graded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on the basis of external appearance
and freshness. The top grade, AA, indicates that the egg is fresh, with a white that will not
spread unduly once the egg is broken, and a yolk that rides high on the white’s surface. The
yolk should also be anchored in place by membranes known as the chalazae.
Eggs come in a number of sizes: jumbo, extra large, large, medium, small, and peewee.
Younger hens, also known as pullets, produce smaller eggs, which are often regarded as
better quality than larger eggs. Medium eggs are best for breakfast cookery, where the
cooked egg’s appearance is important. Large and extra-large eggs are generally used for
cooking and baking, where the whole egg’s appearance is less critical.
Eggs are also sold in several processed forms: bulk or fluid whole eggs (which sometimes
include a percentage of extra yolks to obtain a specific blend), egg whites, and egg yolks.
Pasteurized eggs are used in preparations such as salad dressings, eggnog, or desserts,
where the traditional recipe may have indicated that the eggs should be raw. These products
generally are available in liquid or frozen form.
Dried powdered eggs are also available, and may be useful for some baked goods or in
certain circumstances. For instance, on board a ship, it may not be possible to properly store
fresh eggs for the duration of a voyage.
Egg substitutes may be entirely egg-free or may be produced from egg whites, with dairy or
vegetable products substituted for the yolks. These substitutes are important for people who
require an egg-free diet.

CHAPTER 9

DRY GOODS
IDENTIFICATION
Dry goods include a wide range of
ingredients that are essential to
almost every preparation in any
foodservice operation. They must be
chosen, purchased, and stored with
the same degree of care as required
by fresh meats or produce.

PURCHASING AND STORAGE
Dry goods are also referred to as nonperishable goods. However, like perishable goods,
these ingredients lose quality over time. Keeping an adequate stock on hand is essential
to a smooth-running operation, but having too much ties up necessary space and money.
Rotating dry goods and observing a rule of “first in, first out” is just as important for dry
goods as it is for more perishable foods.
Store dry goods in an area that is dry, properly ventilated, and accessible. All goods should
be placed above floor level on shelving or pallets. Some dry items, such as whole grains, nuts
and seeds, and coffee (if they are not vacuum packed, and after the seals are broken), are
best stored in the refrigerator or even the freezer.

GRAINS, MEALS, AND FLOURS
This broad category extends from whole grains such as rice and barley to cornmeal and
pastry flour. Grains are versatile and universal foods enjoyed worldwide, in every cuisine and
culture. While they are important sources of nutrition, it is also their subtle but satisfying
flavors and textures that give them such culinary importance.
Wheat and corn are of primary importance in Western countries such as the United States
and Canada. Rice is fundamental to many Asian cuisines. In fact, in many Asian languages,
the word for rice is the same as that for food. Other cultures rely upon grains such as oats,
rye, and buckwheat.
Grains are the fruits and seeds of cereal grasses. For the most part, they are inexpensive
and readily available, and provide a valuable and concentrated source of nutrients and fiber.
Although grains differ in appearance from other fruits (e.g., apples and pears), their structure
is quite similar.
Whole grains are grains that have not been milled. They tend to have a shorter life span than
milled grains and therefore should be purchased in amounts that can be used in a relatively
short period of time—­2 to 3 weeks. Milled grains have been polished; that is, they have had
the germ, bran, and/or hull removed. Although milled grains tend to last longer, some of their
nutritive value is lost during the processing.
Milled grains that are broken into coarse particles may be referred to as cracked. If the milling
process continues, meals and cereals (cornmeal, farina, and cream of rice) are formed.
Finally, the grain may be ground into a fine powder known as flour.
Various methods are used for milling: crushing between metal rollers, grinding between
stones, or cutting with steel blades in an action similar to that of a food processor. Stoneground grains may be preferable in some cases because they remain at a lower temperature
during processing compared to other types of milling and so retain more of their nutritive
value. The following tables describe some of the available forms for several different grains.

Wheat Flour When milled into flour, wheat is generally used to produce baked items.
Gluten, the substance formed from wheat’s proteins, provides elasticity and structure that
aids in the development of baked goods, specifically bread. Wheat is classified by season
and color as follows: hard red winter wheat, hard white winter wheat, hard red spring wheat,
soft red winter wheat, and soft white winter wheat. (Durum wheat is a particular type of hard
wheat.) Winter wheat is planted in the winter and harvested the following summer; spring
wheat is planted in the spring and harvested that summer. Generally, spring wheat produces
the hardest flours and winter wheat the softest.

Rice A staple food to at least half of the world’s communities, rice is an invaluable and
versatile ingredient. This starchy whole grain complements nearly any flavor component with
which it’s paired.
Rice is commercially classified by size (long, medium, and short grain). The two main types of
rice are white and brown. White rice is milled, while brown rice is unmilled, resulting in a more
nutritious and fiber-packed grain.

Nuts and Seeds Nuts are the fruits of various trees, with the exception of the peanut,
which grows underground in the root system of a leguminous plant. Nuts are available in the
shell, shelled and roasted, blanched, sliced, slivered, halved, and chopped. Nuts are also used
to produce butters, such as the ever-popular peanut butter.
Considering that nuts are somewhat expensive, storing them properly is a must. They are
susceptible to turning rancid rather quickly. Nuts that have not been roasted or shelled will
keep longer. Shelled nuts may be stored in the freezer or refrigerator to allow for an extended
shelf life.

Dried Spices Spices are aromatics produced primarily from the bark and seeds of
plants. They have long been used as flavor additives for savory and sweet dishes. Dried spices
are available whole, ground, or as spice blends.
Whole spices will generally keep longer than ground spices. Dried spices are best stored in
sealed containers in a cool, dry environment, away from extreme heat and direct light. For
best results, purchase whole spices and grind them just prior to using.

Salt and Pepper Long valued for their preservation qualities, both salt (sodium
chloride) and pepper have been prized for centuries. However, with refrigeration widely used
today, they have become less important as preservatives.
Available in many forms, salt is a precious mineral that can be obtained from two different
sources and processes; it is either mined or evaporated from seawater. Free of shelf life
concerns, salt is best stored in a dry place. In humid weather, salt may cake together; to
prevent this, mix a few grains of rice in with the salt.
Peppercorns are berries grown on trees in tropical regions around the world. The type and
flavor of peppercorn depends on when it is harvested. Whole peppercorns will retain their
flavor almost indefinitely, but they must be crushed or ground for the flavor to be released.

Sweeteners Once a symbol of wealth and prosperity, sugar is now widely used in all
facets of the professional kitchen. Sugar is extracted from plant sources (sugar beets and
sugarcane) and refined into the desired form. Most varieties of syrup, such as maple, corn,
molasses, and honey, are derived from plants as well. The flavor intensity of sweeteners
typically corresponds with the color—­the darker the sugar or syrup, the more concentrated
the flavor.
Sugar is responsible for the caramelization process, balancing the acidity in foods, and
contributing to the appearance, flavor, and viscosity of glazes, sauces, and marinades. In the
bakeshop, sugar adds sweetness, retains moisture, prolongs freshness/shelf life, aids in the
creaming process, and imparts color and flavor to crusts. Selecting the proper sweetener will
help determine the desired end product.

FATS AND OILS
The uses for fats and oils in the professional kitchen or bakeshop are innumerable. Fat
provides a rich flavor, silky mouthfeel and texture, and pleasing aroma. It also performs a
multitude of chemical functions such as tenderizing, leavening, aiding in moisture retention,
and creating flaky/crumbly textures. Fats and oils act as insulators for food, transfer heat
to food, prevent sticking, emulsify or thicken sauces, and create crisp textures when used
for frying.
While they are similar in many ways, fat is solid at room temperature, while oil is liquid. Oils
are produced by pressing a high-oil food, such as olives, nuts, corn, or soybeans. The liquid is
then filtered, clarified, or hydrogenated to produce an oil or a fat (shortening).
The smoke point of a fat or an oil greatly determines its appropriate use. For example, the
higher the smoke point, the better suited it is for frying because it can withstand higher
heat ranges.

MISCELLANEOUS DRY GOODS
Chocolate
Chocolate is produced from cocoa beans, which grow in a pod on the cacao tree. For the
ancient Aztecs, cocoa beans served not only to produce drinks and as a component of
various sauces, but also as currency. Today, chocolate is usually found in a variety of sweets,
including cakes, candies, and other desserts, although it is also used in savory entrées such
as mole poblano, a turkey dish of Mexican origin.
The chocolate extraction process is lengthy and has undergone a great deal of refinement
since the days of the Aztecs. The first stage involves crushing the kernels into a paste; at this
point it is completely unsweetened and is called chocolate liquor. The liquor is then further
ground to give it a smoother, finer texture, and sweeteners and other ingredients may be
added. The liquor may be pressed, causing cocoa butter to be forced out. The cocoa solids
that are left are ground into cocoa powder. Cocoa butter may be combined with chocolate
liquor to make eating chocolate, or it may be flavored and sweetened to make white
chocolate. Cocoa butter also has numerous pharmaceutical and cosmetic uses.
Chocolate should be stored, well wrapped, in a cool, dry, ventilated area. Under most
conditions, it should not be refrigerated, since this could cause moisture to condense on the
surface. Sometimes stored chocolate develops a white “bloom”; the bloom merely indicates
that some of the cocoa butter has melted and then recrystallized on the surface. Chocolate
with a bloom can still be used safely. Cocoa powder should be stored in tightly sealed
containers in a dry place. It will keep almost indefinitely.
164 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

Vinegars and Condiments
Vinegars and most condiments are used to introduce sharp, piquant, sweet, or hot flavors
into foods. They may be used as an ingredient or served on the side, to be added according
to a guest’s taste. A well-stocked kitchen should include a full range of vinegars, mustards,
relishes, pickles, olives, jams, and other condiments. In general, vinegars and condiments
should be stored in the same manner as oils and shortenings.

Extracts
The chef uses a variety of flavoring extracts for cooking and baking. Herbs, spices, nuts, and
fruits are used to prepare extracts, which are alcohol-based. Common flavors include vanilla,
lemon, mint, and almond. Extracts can lose their potency if they are allowed to come in
contact with air, heat, or light. To preserve flavor, store extracts in tightly capped dark jars or
bottles away from heat or direct light.

Leaveners
Leaveners are used to give foods a light, airy texture. Chemical leaveners, such as baking
soda (sodium bicarbonate) and baking powder (a combination of baking soda, cream of
tartar, and cornstarch), work rapidly. Baking powder is usually double acting, which means
that one reaction happens in the presence of moisture, when liquids are added to dry
ingredients, and a second occurs in the presence of heat, as the item bakes in the oven.
Yeast leavens foods by the process of fermentation, which produces alcohol and carbon
dioxide. The gas is trapped by the dough, creating a number of small pockets, and the alcohol
burns off during baking.
Chemical leaveners should be kept perfectly dry. Dried yeast can be held for extended
periods, but fresh yeast has a short shelf life; it will last only a few weeks under refrigeration.

Thickeners
Thickeners are used to give liquid a certain amount of viscosity. The process of forming an
emulsion is one way to thicken a liquid, as is the process of reduction. In addition, various
thickening ingredients can be used. These include arrowroot, cornstarch, filé powder, and
gelatin, to name a few.

Wines, Cordials, and Liqueurs
A general rule of thumb for selecting wines, cordials, and liqueurs for use in cooking and
baking: If it is not suitable for drinking, it is not suitable for cooking.
Brandies and cognacs, Champagne, dry red and white wines, port, Sauternes, sherry, stouts,
ales, beers, and sweet and dry vermouth are commonly used in the kitchen. For baking
purposes, the chef should keep on hand bourbon, crème de cassis, fruit brandies, gin, Kahlúa,
rum, and Scotch. Purchase wines and cordials that are affordably priced and of good quality.
Table wines (e.g., Burgundies, Chablis, and Chardonnays) lose their flavor and become acidic
once opened, especially when subjected to heat, light, and air. To preserve flavor, keep them
in closed bottles or bottles fitted with pouring spouts, and refrigerate when not needed.
Fortified wines (e.g., Madeiras, sherries, and ports) are more stable than table wines and can
be held in dry storage. The same also applies to cordials, Cognacs, and liqueurs.

CHAPTER 10

FABRICATING
MEATS, POULTRY,
AND FISH
Meat, poultry, and fish are the most costly
part of the food budget of a foodservice
operation, no matter the establishment’s
scale. Generally, the size and scope of the
operation determine the form in which it
purchases meats, poultry, and fish. For
operations with limited labor and storage
resources, quality prefabricated boxed
meats, poultry, and fish are an acceptable
purchasing form.

Chefs with the means to do so often prefer to perform many fabrication tasks in-­house
to control portion size and quality—­important considerations when it comes to the
establishment’s reputation.

MEAT FABRICATION
Depending on the prevailing local market rates for food and labor, in-­house fabrication may
be less expensive than buying prefabricated menu cuts. As a further economic benefit, trim
and bones can be used to prepare other dishes (e.g., stocks, soups, sauces, and forcemeats).
General similarities exist between cuts of beef, veal, lamb, venison, and pork if they come
from the same parts of the butchered animal. Muscle sections that are used more frequently
or perform arduous tasks will be tougher than more sedentary muscle groups. Muscles that
are located along the back are used less frequently than muscles that are at the extremities.
Therefore, the rib and the loin contain the most tender cuts. They tend to cost more than cuts
from the shoulder, which are often more exercised and tougher. The leg may contain tender
cuts as well as cuts that are quite tough. The age and method of raising the animal also
determine a level of tenderness. What may be considered a quality cut in one species can be
quite tough in another animal.
Proper handling during fabrication prepares meats for subsequent cooking. The basic
techniques include trimming, boning, portion cutting, tenderizing, grinding, and tying. Most
of the techniques described here do not require any special knowledge of the bones in a cut
of meat or of the animal’s overall anatomy, although reference to sections of Chapter 5 Meat,
Poultry, and Game Identification, will be helpful.

Trimming a Tenderloin
A whole pork loin often costs less per pound than a trimmed boneless loin. Removing the fat
and bones is relatively easy, and the bones and any lean trim can then be roasted and used to
prepare a rich brown jus or stock. It may take some time at first to learn how to properly trim
and bone a loin for a roast or cutlets.

1

Lift and pull away the chain of an untrimmed tenderloin. This chain pulls away easily;
use the blade of a boning knife to steady the tenderloin as the chain is pulled away. If
necessary, use the boning knife to help remove it from the tenderloin.

2

Completely remove the membrane, collagen, and silverskin. Work so that your cuts
move toward the head (the larger end of the tenderloin). This tough membrane, which
gets its name from its somewhat silvery color, tends to shrink when exposed to heat
and causes uneven cooking. Work the top of a boning knife under the silverskin and
hold it tight against the meat. Glide the knife blade just underneath, angling the blade
upward slightly against the silverskin. A tenderloin of beef is shown here, but the same
techniques can be applied to pork, veal, and lamb tenderloin, as well as to other cuts of
meat with silverskin, including top round of beef and veal and loin cuts of venison and
other large game.

chapter 10 • FABRICATING MEATS, POULTRY, AND FISH | 169

2
Shaping a Medallion
Boneless cuts from the tenderloin of beef and the loin or tenderloin of veal, lamb, or pork
may be called medallions, noisettes (so named because they are like little nuts of meat),
or grenadins (large cuts from the loin). The terms noisette and medallion are often used
interchangeably to refer to a small, boneless tender cut of meat weighing from 2 to 6 oz/57 to
170 g. Tournedos and chateaubriand are special terms generally used only for beef tenderloin
cuts. Tournedos are typically cut from the thinner end of the tenderloin to weigh 5 oz/142 g.
Châteaubriand serves two and is cut from the center of the tenderloin; it typically weighs
10 oz/284 g.
After the medallions or similar boneless cuts are portioned, they may then be wrapped in
cheesecloth and molded to give them a compact, uniform shape. Not only does this give
the meat a more pleasing appearance, it also helps the medallion cook evenly. Gather the
cheesecloth together and twist to tighten it around the meat. As you twist the cloth with one
hand, press down on the meat firmly, with even, moderate pressure, using the broad side of
a knife blade or a similar flat object. The medallions shown here on the left have been shaped
and are of a more uniform size.

Fabricating Boneless Meats
Meats to be sautéed or pan fried, grilled, or stewed are often fabricated from larger boneless
cuts such as rounds, loins, and/or tenderloins. These cuts are typically composed of more
than one muscle. Each muscle has its own grain (direction) in which the meat fibers are
arranged. Breaking a larger cut into individual sections allows the chef to cut each piece of
meat properly for the recipe or menu item.

1

To divide larger cuts (veal top round shown here), follow the natural muscle seams—­
they act as a roadmap to define specific cuts. This makes it possible to cut each muscle
across the grain and easily trim out any connective tissue or fat.

2

Using the same technique as described for a beef tenderloin, trim away the fat and
silverskin. Pay attention to the angle of the knife blade. It should be angled upward to
prevent removing edible meat.

3

Cutting the meat across the grain produces a cut of meat that is less tough than a piece
cut with the grain.

sautéed, the cut should be one of
the most tender. This technique
can be used for beef, lamb, and
even pork. Be sure to trim the meat
completely before cutting it into
émincé. Once cut, the émincé may
be pounded, if appropriate, using
the same technique as for pounding
cutlets. Blot the pounded émincé dry

Cutlets are often pounded to ensure an even thickness over their entire area so
that they can be rapidly sautéed or pan fried. A paillard is a pounded cutlet that
is grilled rather than sautéed or pan fried. Adjust the weight of the mallet and
strength of the blow to match the delicacy of the meat. Turkey cutlets (slices of
turkey breast), for example, require a more delicate touch than pork cutlets. Be
careful not to tear or overstretch the meat while pounding it.

help to prevent tears in the meat when cutting.

Place the meat in between layers of plastic wrap. Use a pounding and
pulling motion to evenly thin the cutlet. Increased surface area and
decreased thickness promote rapid cooking.

Cutting Bone-­in Chops
Chops and steaks are made from bone-­in cuts from the rib or loin. Large bones can be
difficult to saw through, but the bones of cuts from the rib and loin of pork, lamb, venison, and
beef are more manageable.

1

Cut away the backbone, often referred to as the chine bone, using a handsaw.
Completely sever the bone from the rib bones without cutting into the meat muscle.

2

Using your guiding hand to hold the chine bone away from the meat, work with the tip of
a boning knife to make smooth strokes along the feather bones, cutting the meat cleanly
away from the bones.

3

Cut between each rib bone with a scimitar or chef’s knife to make individual chops.
When cutting through the meat, use even pressure to create a smooth surface on
the chops.

Trimming a Strip Loin and Cutting Boneless Steaks
Steaks cut in-­house can keep the kitchen’s food cost down. Cuts must be made evenly to
guarantee even cooking time.

1

The strip loin has a tail, sometimes referred to as a lip, running along one edge of the
muscle. Cut away this heavy layer of fat first, taking care not to cut the interior loin
muscle. Hold this fat cover taut as you run the knife blade down the length of the loin,
angling the blade up slightly. Remove 1 1/2 to 2 in/4 to 5 cm of the fat cover.

2

A strip loin may have a section known as the chain. Once the fat cover is trimmed to the
desired thickness, remove the chain. Reserve it for another use.

3

The chef is cutting steaks from the rib end of the strip loin. The steak on the left has been
cut from this end. The V-­shaped streak of collagen was removed and the steak on the
right was cut from the sirloin end. While steaks cut from this end are as tender as those
cut from the rib end, the collagen itself is tough, and can give the impression that the
steak is tough. These steaks are sometimes referred to as vein steaks.

Adjust the thickness of the cut to produce equal-­size steaks of the desired weight. Refrigerate
cut steaks until ready to cook.

Trimming and Boning a Pork Loin
A whole pork loin often costs less than a trimmed boneless loin. Removing the fat and bones
is relatively easy, and the bones and any lean trim can then be roasted and used to prepare a
rich brown jus or stock. It may take some time at first to learn how to properly trim and bone
a loin for a roast or cutlets.

1

The novice should cut slowly and stop to examine the loin between cuts. The first step
when working with a pork loin is to remove the tenderloin, if it is still intact. Next, cut
away the fat cover to the desired thickness. Make smooth strokes along the rib bones to
free the meat, as shown here. Pull the bones away from the meat with your guiding hand
to make it easy to see and prevent cuts into the edible meat. Pass the knife close to the
bones, scraping them clean so that as little meat as possible is left on the bones.

2

Use the tip of the knife to cut around joints and between bones, and use the flat part
of the blade for longer, sweeping strokes. Near the bottom of the rib bones is a knob-­
shaped ridge or step that must be cut around to completely remove the meat from the
bone. It has almost a right angle that must be cut around. Take care not to cut into the
edible meat when cutting around the step.

Once the loin has been trimmed and boned, it can be used to prepare a wide variety of menu
cuts including medallions, cutlets, and émincé.

Boning a Leg of Lamb
Although this procedure may look difficult, it is possible to do it successfully by following the
steps shown in the accompanying images.
The leg is covered with a layer of fat and a membrane known as the fell. The fat and
membrane should be removed carefully, leaving as much edible meat intact as possible.
A leg of lamb can be boned out to use in several different ways. It can be butterflied and
grilled, or rolled, tied, and roasted. The meat can be divided along the natural seams to make
small roasts, or sliced into cutlets or cubes.

1

The leg contains the hind shank bone, the pelvic bones (consisting of the hip bone
and the aitch bone), a portion of the backbone and tail, and the leg bone (also known
as the femur).

2

Work the tip of the knife around the pelvic bone. As you cut into the meat to remove the
bones, use an overhand grip to hold your boning knife and cut with the tip of the blade as
you work around bones and joints. Work the knife tip along the bone to remove as much
meat as possible from the bone.

Frenching a Rack of Lamb
This is one of the more complicated fabrication techniques, but it is not especially difficult
to master. Trimmed and frenched racks or chops can be ordered from a meat purveyor, of
course, but the chef can exercise greater control over trim loss if the work is done in the
kitchen. The same technique can be used to french individual rib chops of lamb, veal, or pork.
Any lean trim can be used to prepare jus or a stock.

1

Make an even cut through the fat covering all the way down to the bone. The cut should
be about 1 in/3 cm from the meat’s eye.

2

Set the rack on one end and make a stabbing cut between each pair of bones, using the
initial cut as a guide.

Tying a Roast
Tying a roast with secure knots that have the right tension is one of the simplest
and most frequently required types of meat fabrication. It ensures that the
roast will cook evenly and that it will retain its shape after roasting. As long as
the string is taut enough to give the roast a compact shape, without being too
tight, the result will be fine. Leave the string very long so that it will wrap easily
around the entire diameter and length of the meat. Or leave the string attached
to the spool and cut it only when the entire roast has been tied.

Technique One
For this technique, the string is left attached to the spool rather than cut into
lengths. To start tying the roast, tie the end of the string around the thicker end
of the meat (any knot that holds securely may be used).

1

Pass the string around your outspread fingers and thumb so that the string
crosses itself and makes an X.

2

Spread your hand open to enlarge the loop.

3

Continue to enlarge the loop until it is wide enough to pass easily around
the thicker end of the meat, completely encircling it.

4

Encircle the meat with the loop, making sure that the knots are spaced
evenly apart from one another.

7

Pull the loose end of the string until the loop is securely tightened around
the meat. Note that the string has formed a half hitch knot at this point.
Continue until the entire piece of meat has been secured with loops.

6

Turn the piece of meat over. Pass the loose end of the string through the
loop, then pass it back around and underneath the loop. Pull the string
tight and continue down the length of the meat.

7

Once the string has been wrapped around each loop from one end to
the other, turn the meat back over. Cut the loose end and tie the string
securely to the first loop.

Technique Two
For this tying technique, cut several lengths of string. Each piece should be long
enough to wrap completely around the meat with sufficient additional length to
tie a series of double knots.
There are other methods used for tying roasts than the two shown here. If you
have the chance to learn other methods, you will be better able to adapt to
tying different cuts of meat with ease.
Both techniques illustrated here work for both boneless and bone-­in roasts.
The choice of technique is a matter of personal preference.

Liver
Prepare liver before cooking by removing any silverskin,
tough membranes, veins, and gristle. When subjected to
intense heat, silverskin shrinks more rapidly than meat,
making the liver pucker and cook unevenly.

Kidneys
The unique flavor of kidneys will come through as long
as they are perfectly fresh and properly handled. Soak
kidneys in salted water for 12 hours, then rinse well and
soak in milk for another 12 to 24 hours. Rinse the kidneys,
then cut them in half and remove all of the fat and veins.
In some cases, recipes may indicate that the kidneys
be blanched first. Peel the kidneys by pulling away the
membrane covering them.

Once peeled, tongue can be used in a variety of ways: It
can be cut into julienne or dice and used as a garnish for
sauces, soups, or pâtés. It may be thinly sliced and served
hot or cold, or used as a liner for terrine molds.

Marrow
Marrow—­the soft inner substance of bones—­is often used
as a garnish for soups, sauces, and other dishes. Certain
bones, known as marrow bones, have a significant amount
of marrow that is relatively easy to remove using the
following technique: Submerge the marrow bones in cold,
salted water for a few hours to remove the excess blood
and impurities. After they have soaked, push the marrow
out with your thumb.

Sweetbreads
Sweetbreads are the thymus gland of veal. It is a soft-­
structured gland that can be cut with a fork, when
properly prepared. This particular offal is considered a
delicacy and warrants a high cost.

Grinding Meat
Grinding meat calls for scrupulous attention to safe food handling practices. This fabrication
technique applies to poultry and fish as well as meats. Observe the following procedures for
best results:
• Unplug the grinder before assembling or disassembling.
• Clean the grinder well and put it together correctly. Make sure that the blade is sitting
flush against the die. In this position, the blade cuts the food neatly, rather than tearing or
shredding it.
• Cut the meat into dice or strips that will fit easily through the grinder’s feed tube.
• Chill meats thoroughly before grinding. Chill all grinder parts that will come in contact with
the food by either refrigerating them or submerging them in ice water.
• Do not force the meat through the feed tube with a tamper. If they are the correct size, the
pieces will be drawn easily by the worm.
• Be sure that the blade is sharp. Meat should be cut cleanly, never mangled or mashed, as it
passes through the grinder.
• For all but very delicate meats (e.g., salmon or other fish), begin with a die with large
openings. The meat will appear quite coarse.
• Grind through progressively smaller dies until the desired consistency is achieved.
• A final pass through a fine die gives the ground meat a more refined texture, and further
blends the lean meat and fat.

POULTRY FABRICATION
Poultry, always popular and readily available, is among the least costly meats used for
entrées and other menu items. Fabrication techniques are demonstrated here on a chicken,
the bird most used in restaurants. These techniques can be applied to virtually all poultry
types, not only chicken but squab, duck, pheasant, turkey, and quail, with some modification
for size (smaller birds require more delicate, precise cuts; larger or older birds, a heavier
blade and greater pressure to break through tough joints and sinew).
The goose is typically larger than the duck or chicken, but the bone structure is similar. The
difficulty in fabrication lies in the fact that the goose is very fatty, making the definition of
where to cut a little challenging.
The younger the bird, the easier it is to cut up. Young birds are usually much smaller and
their bones have not completely hardened. The size and breed of the bird will also have
some bearing on how easy or difficult it is to fabricate. Chickens are generally far simpler
to cut up, for example, than are pheasant. The tendons and ligaments in chicken are less
well developed, except in the case of free-­range birds, which move freely about an enclosed
pen or yard.
When fabricating, pay close attention to food safety regulations. Some kitchens use
color-­coded cutting boards to avoid cross contamination between meat, poultry, fish, and
vegetables. Regardless of the material that cutting boards are made of (wood or plastic
resin), they will remain sanitary if properly cleaned.

Preparing a Suprême
A suprême is a semiboneless poultry breast half, usually from a chicken,
pheasant, partridge, or duck, so named because it is considered by some the
best (suprême) portion. One wing joint, often frenched, is left attached to the
breast meat. If the skin is removed from the suprême, it may be referred to as a

côtelette. Suprêmes may be sautéed, poached, or grilled.
To prepare a chicken suprême from a whole chicken by this technique, you
must cut away the wing tip and remove the legs. The breast meat and the first
joint of the wing are then cut away from the bird’s carcass. Reserve the carcass
for stock or broth.

1

Use the tip of a boning knife to make a cut that circles around the second
joint of the wing bone. Make sure to cut through the web skin as well. Bend
the wing bone at the second joint to snap it. Continue to cut through the
joint until the wing tip and wing flap are removed, leaving the drumette
attached to the breast.

2

Cut through the skin between the thigh and the breast.

3

Bend the leg backward, away from the body, to expose the ball socket.
Make a cut that runs along the backbone to the ball and socket, as shown.
Hold the chicken stable with the heel of your knife, and pull the leg away
from the body firmly and evenly. This will remove the leg and the oyster
cleanly from the backbone structure. Repeat on the other side.

With the breast facing up, cut along either side of the keel bone with a

Trussing Poultry
The object of trussing or tying any bird is to give it a smooth, compact shape so that it will
cook evenly and retain moisture. Several different methods for trussing poultry exist, some
involving trussing needles, some requiring only string. One simple way of tying with string is
shown here.

1

Cut away the wing tip and wing flap. Pass the middle of a piece of string underneath the
joints at the end of the drumsticks, and cross the ends of the string to make an X. Pull
the ends of the string down toward the tail to loop the string around the joints.

2

Pull both ends of the string tightly across the joint that connects the drumstick and the
thigh and continue to pull the string along the body toward the bird’s back, catching the
wing underneath the string.

3

Flip the bird over and pull the string tight. Make an X across the wings to hold them
tightly against the bird.

Halving and Quartering Poultry
Chicken and other birds may be halved or quartered before or after cooking. Smaller birds,
such as Cornish game hens and broiler chickens, that are to be grilled are often halved.
These birds are small enough to cook through completely before the skin becomes scorched
or charred. If the bones are left intact during grilling, they provide some protection against
shrinkage.
In many restaurants, the ducks needed for an evening’s service will be roasted in advance,
then halved and partially deboned; then at service it is necessary only to reheat the duck and
crisp the skin in a hot oven.

1

Cut from the tail to the neck opening down either side of the backbone. Pull upward
slightly while cutting down, exerting enough pressure to cut through the rib bones.

Disjointing a Rabbit
The technique for disjointing a rabbit is similar to that for a chicken. Rabbit is a relatively lean,
mildly flavored meat. The loin and rib sections are leaner than the legs, in much the same way
that chicken breast is leaner than the legs. By removing the legs and shoulder, you can apply
two different cooking methods to one rabbit—­moist heat for the legs, dry heat for the loin—­to
achieve the most satisfactory results.

1

Spread open the belly cavity of the rabbit and pull out the kidneys and liver. Sever any
membrane attaching the liver to the cavity. Reserve the liver for another use, if desired.

2

Remove the hind legs by cutting through the joint and then through the meat to separate
the hind leg from the loin.

FISH FABRICATION
Much of the fish purchased by chefs is filleted either by hand or with specialized filleting
machines. These fish fillets have become so commonplace that whole fish are often more
difficult and expensive for the average commercial food seller to obtain and transport to the
local restaurant or retail operation. When purchasing seafood for a restaurant, wholesale
seafood sellers are much better equipped to handle whole fish and understand its quality.
Most fish fall into one of two categories: round or flat. Time, practice, and experience will help
determine which of a number of techniques to use to fabricate a particular fish. Different
methods can achieve virtually the same results, and the methods shown here are not always
the only way to proceed. The reality is that filleting fish is a messy process that takes time,
space, and skill, but freshness indicators such as clear eyes, aroma, bright gills, and firmness
of the flesh cannot be evaluated if the fish is not whole. Along with evaluation of the quality
and freshness, it is much easier to determine the species by looking at a whole fish as
opposed to fillets, with the added advantage that the leftover bones can be used to make
valuable fish stock.
The basic procedure for scaling—­the first step in preparing the fish before any further
fabrication is done—­applies to all types of fish. Methods differ slightly, however, for gutting
round fish and flat fish. Similarly, the technique for filleting a round fish is different from
that used for a flat fish. In determining how to fabricate a fish, knowledge of that particular
fish’s specific properties is important (see Chapter 6 Fish and Shellfish Identification).
Other seafood, including crustaceans (lobster, shrimp, crayfish, and crab), mollusks (clams,
oysters, and mussels), and cephalopods (squid and octopus) also must be carefully handled
to maintain quality and wholesomeness.

Filleting Round Fish: Straight-­Cut Method
Fillets are one of the most common fabrications for fish.
These boneless and (usually) skinless fish pieces can be
sautéed, grilled, baked, formed into paupiettes, or cut
into tranches or goujonettes.
Round fish are fabricated into two fillets, one from each
side of the fish. There are two techniques for filleting a
round fish. The first technique is used on soft-­boned,
round fish like the salmon and trout family and Spanish
mackerel. The name of the technique for soft-­boned round
fish is the straight-­cut method. The second, for use on
hard-­boned round fish, is called the up and over technique.

1

3

Lay the fish on a cutting board with the backbone
parallel to the work surface and the head on the
same side as your cutting hand. Using a filleting knife, cut behind the head and gill plates. Angle the knife so that the
cutting motion is down and away from the body. This does not cut the head of the fish away from the body.

2

Without removing the knife, turn it so that the cutting edge is pointing toward the tail of the fish. Position the knife so
that the handle is lower than the tip of the blade. This will improve the yield by keeping the knife’s edge aimed at the
bones, rather than the flesh. Run the blade down the length of the fish, cutting against the backbone. Avoid sawing
the blade back and forth.

3

By cutting evenly and smoothly, you will split the tail, as shown. Lay the fillet skin side down on the work surface or in
a hotel pan.

6

Turn the fish over and repeat the previous steps to remove the
second fillet.

5

Remove the belly bones by making smooth strokes against the bones
to cut them away cleanly. If necessary, cut away the remnants of the
backbone by running the blade just underneath the line of the backbone.

6

To remove the skin, lay the fillet parallel to the edge of the cutting surface.
Hold the knife so that the cutting edge is against the skin; pull the skin taut
with your guiding hand as you cut the fillet free.

7

Locate the pin bones by running a fingertip over the fillet. Use needle-­nose
pliers or tweezers to pull out the bones. Pull them out in the direction of
the head of the fillet (with the grain) to avoid ripping the flesh.

Up and Over Technique for Round Fish
The up and over technique may be used only on hard-­boned round fish. A fillet
knife with a flexible blade should be used for this technique.

1

Lay the fish on the cutting board with the belly away from you and the
head toward your dominant, cutting hand. Cut through the belly, under the
pectoral fin, and around the gill plate, making sure to get into the head.

2

Score through the skin from the head to tail using one long stroke.
Continue making long, straight strokes along the back until you reach the
center bone.

3

Flex your knife up and over the center bone, cutting through the pin bones.

4

Continue cutting close to the belly bones until the fillet is free from
the carcass. Skinning is the same as for the straight-­cut method (see
page 197).

Gutting Flat Fish

Fish are typically gutted before they are shipped to market. If a fish has not been gutted, this
step should be performed immediately after scaling.

1

To gut a flat fish, cut around the head, making a V-­shaped notch.

2

Pull the head away from the body while twisting it slightly. The guts will come away with
the head. Rinse the belly cavity thoroughly under cold running water to remove all traces
of viscera and blood.

Filleting Flat Fish: Making Full Fillets
Flat fish can be fabricated into two fillets, one from the top and one from the bottom
of the fish.

1

To make two fillets from a flat fish, use a filleting knife to cut the flesh away from the
bones, starting on an outer edge and working from the tail toward the head.

2

Adjust the direction and length of your strokes to go over the ridge of bones in the center
of the fillet. Hold the fillet up and away from the bones as you work to see the bone
structure. Continue cutting to the other edge and remove the top fillet in a single piece.
Repeat on the other side.

Making Four (or Quarter) Fillets of Flat Fish
Flat fish can be fabricated into four fillets by removing the fillet from each side of the
backbone on the top and again on the bottom.

1

Position the fish with the head facing toward you. Cut to one side of the center ridge.

2

Make cuts along the bones, working from the center to the edge.

3

After the fillet is removed, you can see the roe sack and the belly portion. These should
be trimmed away from the fillet as part of its preparation for cooking.

Cutting Fish into Steaks
Fish steaks are simply crosscuts of the fish and are relatively easy to cut. The fish is scaled,
gutted, and trimmed of its fins and gills. Steaks can be of virtually any thickness. Darnes, a
French term, are thick steaks. There are few flat fish large enough to cut into steaks; however,
round fish like salmon are generally fabricated in this fashion.
Starting with a scaled, gutted, and trimmed fish (in this case salmon), use a chef’s knife to
make crosswise cuts through the fish to yield steaks of the desired size. Pan-­dressed fish are
smaller, dressed fish that are usually not cut into steaks and are served whole.

SHELLFISH FABRICATION
The main shellfish categories are as follows: crustaceans, with jointed skeletons on the
exterior of their bodies; mollusks, with a single (univalve) or a hinged (bivalve) shell; and
cephalopods, with tentacles. Lobster, shrimp, crayfish, and crab are all crustaceans; mollusks
include clams, oysters, and mussels; squid and octopus are cephalopods. They are all
prepared before cooking using a variety of fabrication techniques.

Working with Live Lobster
Lobster is best when purchased alive.
The first step in preparing a lobster
to boil or steam is to kill it. Lobsters
can also be split before they are
broiled or baked.

1

Leave the bands on the lobster’s
claws and lay it, stomach side
down, on a work surface. Insert
the tip of a chef’s knife into the
base of the head. Pull the knife all
the way down through the shell,
splitting the head in half.

2

Split the tail by reversing the
direction of the lobster and
positioning the tip of the knife at
the point where you made your
initial cut. Then cut through the
shell of the tail section.

Cooked Lobster
The flesh of a lobster or other crustacean adheres tightly to the shell until it has been cooked.
Lobster that will be served out of the shell or used in salads, in stuffings, or as a garnish can
be cooked whole by steaming, grilling, or deep poaching. Once the lobster is cool enough to
handle, the meat can be removed from the shell easily.
The edible meat can be removed from a lobster, as shown, to produce a large tail portion
and intact claw sections as well as smaller pieces from the knuckles and legs. The lobster’s
tomalley (liver) and coral (eggs; only in females) are removed and used as ingredients in
stuffing, sauce, or butter.

1

Hold the tail section securely in one hand and hold the body of the lobster with the other.
Twist your hands in opposite directions, pulling the tail away from the body.

2

Use scissors to cut down both sides of the underside of the lobster tail. Pull the tail meat
out of the shell. It should come away in one piece.

Shrimp
To clean shrimp, remove the shell and the vein that runs along the back of the shrimp either
before or after cooking. Shrimp that have been boiled or steamed in the shell are moister
and plumper than shrimp that were peeled and deveined before cooking. Shrimp that will
be served cold—­in appetizers or salads, for example—­can be cooked in the shell. Shrimp
dishes that are sautéed or grilled usually call for the shrimp to be peeled and deveined before
cooking. The shells can be reserved for other uses, such as making shrimp stock, bisque, or
shellfish butters.

1

To devein a shrimp, lay the shelled shrimp on a work surface, with the curved outer edge
on the same side as your cutting hand. Slice into the shrimp with a paring or utility knife;
make a shallow cut for deveining or a deeper cut for butterflying the shrimp.

2

Use the tip of the knife to scrape out the “vein” (intestinal tract).

3

As an alternative, to remove the vein without cutting the shrimp, hook it with a toothpick
or skewer and pull it out completely.

the upper and lower shells together and twist the knife to break open
the hinge.

Cleaning Squid
Octopus and squid belong to a category of shellfish known as cephalopods. They must be
properly cleaned and cut to make the most of their flavor and texture in any cooked dish.
Small squid and octopi are tender and moist when properly handled, even when cooked
quickly and at high temperatures. Larger ones are better prepared by braising or stewing.
The squid mantle can be cut into rings to sauté, pan fry, or deep fry; or the squid may be left
whole to grill or braise, with or without a stuffing. If desired, the ink sac can be saved and used
to prepare various dishes, which will turn a dramatic black color.

Pull the mantle and the tentacles apart. The eye, ink sac, and intestines will come away

CHAPTER 11

FABRICATING
VEGETABLES
From trimming and peeling to slicing
and dicing, many vegetables and
herbs need advance preparation
before they are ready to serve or use
as an ingredient in a cooked dish.
Various knife cuts are used to shape
vegetables and herbs. A thorough
mastery of knife skills includes the
ability to prepare vegetables and
herbs properly for cutting, to use a
variety of cutting tools, and to make
cuts that are uniform and precise.

CUTTING VEGETABLES
AND FRESH HERBS
Review the information about purchasing and handling produce found in earlier chapters.
Handle fresh produce carefully to maintain its flavor, color, and nutritional value throughout
all stages of preparation and cooking. One key to preserving quality in produce is to perform
all cutting tasks as close as possible to cooking time.
Another important factor is the ability to select the right tool for the job, and to keep that tool
in proper working condition. A steel should be on hand whenever you are cutting any food
to periodically hone your knife blade as you work. For a review of basic knife handling, see
pages 48 to 49.
The basic knife cuts include:
• Chopping
• Mincing
• Chiffonade (shredding)
• Julienne and batonnet
• Dicing
• Paysanne (fermière)
• Diamond (lozenge)
• Rondelle, bias, oblique, or roll cuts
Your aim, whenever you cut something, should always be to cut the food into pieces of
uniform shape and size. Unevenly cut items give an impression of carelessness that can spoil
the dish’s look. An even more important consideration is that foods of different sizes and
shapes won’t cook evenly.
When precise knife cuts, such as julienne, batonnet, brunoise, and dices, are required, it is
important to cut with a “slice” technique. The knife should be held firmly with a balanced grip
and the wrist should be stable. The slicing motion should move either forward or backward.
Do not press the knife straight down or grip the knife with a loose wrist, as this could result in
less accurate cuts.

216 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

1

2

Peeling Vegetables
All fresh produce, even if it will be peeled before cutting, should be washed well. Washing
removes surface dirt and bacteria and other contaminants that might otherwise come in
contact with cut surfaces by way of the knife or peeler. For the best shelf life, wash vegetables
as close to preparation time as possible.
Not all vegetables require peeling before cooking, but when it is necessary, use a tool that will
remove the skin evenly and neatly without taking off too much of the edible flesh. To peel a
thick-­skinned vegetable such as winter squash, use a chef’s knife. Chef’s knives are better for
larger vegetables or those with very tough rinds, such as celeriac or winter squash. Remove
fibrous or tough skins from broccoli and similar vegetables by using a paring knife or swivel-­
bladed peeler to trim away the skin; often it can be pulled away after the initial cut.
Some vegetables and fruits have relatively thin skins or peels. Examples include carrots,
parsnips, asparagus, apples, pears, and potatoes. Peel these with a swivel-­bladed peeler.
These peelers can be used in both directions, so that the skin or peel is removed on both
the downward and upward strokes. A paring knife can be used in place of a peeler in some
instances. Hold the blade’s edge at a 20-­degree angle to the vegetable’s surface and shave
the blade just under the surface to remove a thin layer.

1

Peel a thick-­skinned vegetable such as winter squash with a chef’s knife.

2

Peel vegetables with relatively thin skins or peels, such as asparagus, carrots, or
parsnips, with a swivel-­bladed peeler.

2

Chopping
Coarse chopping is generally used for mirepoix or similar flavoring ingredients that are to
be strained out of the dish and discarded. Chopping is often done with a straight, downward
cutting motion. It is also appropriate when cutting vegetables that will be puréed. Trim
the root and stem ends and peel the vegetables if necessary. Slice or chop through the
vegetables at nearly regular intervals until the cuts are relatively uniform. This need not be a
perfectly neat cut, but all the pieces should be roughly the same size.

1

Rinse and dry herbs well, and then strip the leaves from the stems. Gather the herbs into
a tight ball using your guiding hand to hold them in place, then slice through them to
form coarse but uniform pieces.

2

Once the herbs are coarsely chopped, use the fingertips of your guiding hand to hold
the tip of the chef’s knife in contact with the cutting board. Keeping the tip of the blade
against the cutting board, lower the knife firmly and rapidly, repeatedly cutting through
the herbs.

garnish or bed.
For Belgian endive, remove the leaves
from the core and stack them. Make
parallel lengthwise cuts to produce
a shred. For greens with large leaves,
such as romaine, roll individual
leaves into cylinders before cutting
crosswise. Stack smaller leaves,
such as basil, one on top of the other,
then roll them into cylinders and cut.
Use a chef’s knife to make very fine,
parallel cuts to produce fine shreds.

Before chopping or cutting vegetables, trim them to remove roots, cores, stems, ribs and/or seeds. Round vegetables may also be trimmed
by taking a thin slice away from one side; this makes cutting safer, since the vegetable will not roll or slip as it is cut. To produce very regular
and precise cuts, such as julienne or dice, cut a slice from each side and both ends of the vegetable to make an even rectangular solid or cube.

Turn the potato 45 degrees and make the second pass to create waffle cut potatoes. Run the
vegetable the entire length of the mandoline. Turn the vegetable 45 degrees and repeat the
entire stroke. Repeat this procedure, turning the vegetable 45 degrees on each pass over the
mandoline.

Cutting Turned/Tourné Vegetables
Turning vegetables (tourner in French) requires a series of cuts that simultaneously trim and
shape the vegetable. The shape is similar to a small barrel or football. Peel the vegetable,
if desired, and cut it into pieces of manageable size. Cut large round or oval vegetables,
such as beets and potatoes, into quarters, sixths, or eighths (depending on the size) to
form pieces slightly longer than 2 in/5 cm. Cut cylindrical vegetables, such as carrots, into
2­ in/5-­cm pieces.
Use a paring or tourné knife to cut the vegetables into manageable pieces before tournéing
them. Carve the pieces into barrel or football shapes. Try to make as few cuts as possible to
create the seven sides so that the faces of the tourné remain distinct. The faces should be
smooth, evenly spaced, and tapered so that both ends are narrower than the center.

Onions
Onions of all types taste best when cut as close as possible to the time to be
used. The longer cut onions are stored, the more flavor and overall quality they
lose. Once cut, onions develop a strong sulfurous odor that can spoil a dish’s
aroma and appeal.

1

When peeling an onion, take off as few layers as possible. Here, the chef is
using a paring knife to remove the outer layers of skin.

Use a paring knife to cut thin slices away from the stem and root ends of the
bulb. Catch the peel between the pad of your thumb and the flat side of your
knife blade and pull away the peel. Trim away any brown spots from underlying
layers if necessary before cutting the vegetable to the desired size or shape.
Leave the onion whole after peeling if you need slices or rings. To cut onion
rings from a whole onion, be sure to hold the onion securely with your guiding
hand; the rounded surface of the onion can slip on the cutting board.
Cut the onion in half, making a cut that runs from the root end to the stem end,
in order to cut julienne or dice. The root end, though trimmed, is still intact. This
helps to hold the onion layers together as it is sliced or diced. To cut julienne
from a halved onion, make a V-­shaped notch cut on either side of the root end.
An alternative peeling method is especially good for cutting and using the onion
right away. Halve the onion lengthwise through the root before trimming and
peeling. Trim the ends, leaving the root end intact if the onion will be diced, and
pull away the skin from each half.

Dicing/Mincing Onions
1

To dice or mince an onion half, lay it cut side down on a cutting board.
Use a chef’s knife to make a series of evenly spaced, parallel lengthwise
cuts with the tip of the knife, leaving the root end intact. Cuts spaced
1/4 in/6 mm apart will make small dice; cuts spaced 1/2 in/1 cm or
3/4 in/2 cm apart will produce medium or large dice. Cuts spaced
1/8 in/3 mm apart will produce fine mince.

2

While gently holding the vertical cuts together, make two or three
horizontal cuts parallel to the work surface from the stem end toward the
root end, but do not cut all the way through. Holding the previous cuts
together will produce a more uniform mince.

3

To complete the dice, make even, crosswise cuts working from the stem
end up to the root end, cutting through all layers of the onion. Reserve any
usable trim for mirepoix.

Some chefs prefer to cut onions by making a series of evenly spaced cuts that
follow the natural curve of the onion. Remove the root from the onion before
making even cuts that follow the natural curve of the onion.

Garlic
Depending on how it is cut, garlic may take on different flavors and like onions, once cut, will
become stronger in flavor. Pre-­chopped garlic can be purchased but is best avoided unless
high-­volume cooking calls for its convenience.
Mashed or minced garlic is called for in many preparations, so it is important to have enough
prepared to last through a service period. To prevent bacterial growth, store uncooked
minced garlic covered in oil in the refrigerator and use within 24 hours. It is always best,
however, to cut garlic just prior to use.
To separate the garlic cloves, wrap an entire head of garlic in a side towel and press down on
the top. The cloves will break cleanly away from the root end, and the towel keeps the papery
skin from flying around the work area.

1

At some times of the year and under certain storage conditions, the garlic may begin to
sprout. Split the clove in half and remove the sprout for the best flavor.
Lay the skinned cloves on the cutting board with the flat of the knife blade over them.
Using a motion similar to that for cracking the skin, hit the blade firmly and forcefully
with a fist or the heel of your hand to crush the cloves. An alternative to smashing the
clove of garlic in order to remove the peel is to peel the garlic clove with a paring knife. To
loosen the skin from each clove, place it on the cutting board, place the flat side of the
knife blade on top, and hit the blade using a fist or the heel of your hand. Peel off the skin
and remove the root end and any brown spots.

2

Slice the peeled garlic cloves before chopping them.

paste. If desired, sprinkle the garlic with salt before mashing.
The salt acts as an abrasive, speeding the mashing process
and preventing the garlic from sticking to the knife blade.
Alternatively, crush and grind salt-­sprinkled garlic into a paste
using a mortar and pestle.

Place unpeeled heads of garlic in a small
pan or on a sizzler platter. To produce a drier
texture, place the garlic on a bed of salt. You
may wrap whole heads of garlic in foil. Cut
off the tip of each head beforehand to make
it easier to squeeze out the roasted garlic.
Or peel the cloves first, lightly oil them, and
roast in a parchment paper envelope.

Roast in a 350°F/177°C oven until the
garlic cloves are quite soft, usually
30–45 minutes. Any juices that run
from the garlic will brown. The aroma
should be sweet and pleasing with no
hints of harshness or sulfur. Separate
the cloves and squeeze the roasted
garlic from the skins or pass the
unpeeled cloves through a food mill.

Leeks
A leek grows in layers, trapping grit and sand between each layer, and one of the biggest
concerns when working with leeks is removing every trace of dirt. Careful rinsing is essential.

1

To clean leeks, rinse off all the surface dirt, paying special attention to the roots, where
dirt clings. Lay the leek on the cutting board, and use a chef’s knife to trim away the
heavy, dark green portion of the leaves. By cutting on an angle, you can avoid losing the
tender light green portion of the leek. Reserve the dark green portion of the leek to make
bouquet garni or for other uses.

2

Trim away most of the root end. Cut the leek lengthwise into halves, thirds, or quarters.
Rinse the leek under running water to remove any remaining grit or sand.
Cut the leek into the desired shape. Leeks may be left in halves or quarters with the
stem end still intact for braising. Or they may be cut into slices, chiffonade, or dices, or
paysanne cuts.

Tomatoes
Fresh and canned tomatoes are used in a number of dishes. They can be cut with various
knives as well as sliced using an electric slicer.
Tomatoes have a skin that clings tightly to the flesh, and the interior contains pockets of
seeds and juice. When the tomato is peeled, seeded, and chopped, it is known as tomato
concassé. The techniques for seeding and chopping or dicing can be used for both fresh
and canned tomatoes. Whole or sliced tomatoes can be roasted to intensify their flavor and
change their texture.

Preparing Tomato Concassé
Tomato concassé is required for preparation or finishing many different sauces and dishes.
Only make enough in advance to last through a single service period; once peeled and
chopped, tomatoes begin to lose flavor and texture.
Tomatoes can be cut into different sizes, depending on their use. Fine concassé should be
used for garnishing, while rough concassé can be used for all other purposes, such as an
ingredient in a dish or sauce.

1

Score an X into the bottom of each tomato, but be sure not to cut too deeply. Remove
the stem core.

2

Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Have an ice bath ready to shock the tomatoes. Drop
the tomatoes into the water. Blanch the tomatoes in boiling water for 10–15 seconds,
depending on their ripeness, then remove them and shock them in ice water.

Fresh Peppers and Chiles
Peppers and chiles are used in dishes from cuisines as diverse as those of Central and South
America, many Asian countries, Spain, and Hungary. As the interest in peppers and chiles
has grown, many special varieties have become available, both fresh and dried. Whenever
working with very hot chiles, wear plastic gloves to protect your skin from the irritating oils
they contain.

Cutting and Seeding Fresh Peppers and Chiles
Cut through the pepper from top to bottom. Continue to cut it into quarters, especially if the
pepper is large.
Use the tip of a paring knife to cut away the stem and seeds. This cut removes the least
amount of usable pepper. Chiles retain a good deal of their heat in the seeds, ribs, and
blossom ends. The degree of heat can be controlled by adjusting how much, if any, of these
parts of the chile is added to a dish.

1

You can make very fine, even julienne or dice by filleting the pepper—­that is, removing
the seeds and ribs—­before cutting it. Cut away the top and bottom of the pepper to
create an even rectangle. Roll the pepper away from the paring knife as you cut the
seeds and ribs away to create a long rectangle of pepper that can be cut as desired.

2

Peel away the skin, if desired, and then cut the flesh into neat julienne or dice. For a more
precise preparation, use a chef’s knife to cut away a thin layer of the interior flesh to
make a completely flat surface. This will create more square, uniform julienne or dice.
Reserve any edible scraps to use in purées or coulis, or to flavor broths and stews.

Peeling Fresh Peppers and Chiles
Peppers and chiles are often peeled before they are used in a dish, to improve the dish’s
flavor or texture, or both.

1

Peppers and chiles are often charred in a flame, broiled or grilled, or roasted in a very
hot oven to produce a deep, rich flavor as well as to make the pepper easier to peel.
To roast and peel small quantities of fresh peppers or chiles, hold the pepper over a
medium flame of a gas burner with tongs or a kitchen fork, or place the pepper on a grill.
Turn the pepper and roast it until the surface is evenly charred. Place the pepper in a
plastic or paper bag or a covered bowl and let stand for at least 30 minutes to steam the
skin loose.

2

When the pepper is cool enough to handle, use a paring knife to remove the charred skin.
Have a bowl of water nearby to rinse the charred skin off of your knife as you work. To
remove any bits of charred skin that remain on the pepper, rub lightly with a towel.
Larger quantities of peppers or chiles are often roasted in a hot oven or under a broiler,
rather than charred individually over a flame. Halve the peppers or chiles and remove
the stems, seeds, and ribs if desired. (The peppers or chiles may also be left whole.)
Place cut side down on an oiled sheet pan. Place the pan in a very hot oven or under a
broiler. Roast or broil until evenly charred. Remove from the oven or broiler and cover
immediately, using an inverted sheet pan. Let stand for 30 minutes to steam the peppers
and make the skin easier to remove.

Some mushrooms must have the stems removed. Shiitakes, for example, have

morels, and cèpes, can usually be left intact, although a slice should be cut
away from the stem end to trim dried or fibrous portions.
If possible, rest the mushroom on a flat side to provide more stability as you
slice through it. Holding the mushroom cap with your guiding hand, make slices
through the cap and stem (if it has not been trimmed off). To cut a large amount
efficiently, slice the mushrooms so that the slices are layered. Then cut across
the slices at the desired thickness to create julienne strips. Turn the julienne
strips so that they are parallel to the edge of the work surface. Make crosswise
cuts to mince the mushrooms for use in duxelles or other applications.

Asparagus
Young asparagus may need no further preparation than a simple trim to remove the very
ends of the stalk, and a quick rinse. More mature asparagus may need to have the stalk
trimmed a little more and partially peeled to remove the outer skin, which can be tough
and stringy.
As asparagus matures, the stalk becomes tough. To remove the woody portion, bend the
stalk gently until it snaps. Use a special asparagus peeler or a swivel-­bladed peeler to peel the
remaining stalk partway up; this enhances palatability and also makes it easier to cook the
asparagus evenly.
Asparagus may be tied into loose portion-­size bundles to make it easier to remove them
from boiling water when they are blanched or boiled. Don’t tie them too tightly or make the
bundles more than a few inches in diameter. Otherwise the asparagus in the middle will not
cook properly.

Artichokes
Artichoke leaves have sharp barbs, like thorns. The edible meat of the artichoke is found at
the base of each leaf, which grows from a stem, as well as at the fleshy base of the vegetable,
known as the heart. Artichokes have a purple, feathery center—­the choke—­that is inedible in
mature artichokes. The choke in baby artichokes may be tender enough to eat.
To prepare whole artichokes, first cut away part or all of the stem. The amount of stem
removed is determined by how the artichoke is to be presented, as well as by how tender
or tough the stem is. Cutting away the stem even with the bottom of the artichoke makes a
flat surface, allowing the artichoke to sit flat on the plate. If the artichoke is to be halved or
quartered, some of the stem may be left intact. Peel the stem with a paring knife. Cut off the
upper part of the top of the artichoke. Snip the barbs from each leaf with kitchen scissors.
Rub the cut surfaces with lemon juice to prevent browning, or hold the trimmed artichoke in
acidulated water (a mixture of lemon juice and water) or a blanc. To remove the choke, spread
open the leaves of the artichoke. The choke can now be scooped out with a spoon.

Avocados
Avocados have a rough, thick skin and a large pit. Avocados, like potatoes, bananas, and
artichokes, turn brown when they are exposed to air. To prevent browning, cut avocados as
close to the time of service as possible. Citrus juice both brightens the flavor of this rich but
relatively bland food and prevents the flesh from turning brown.
To remove the skin and pit from an avocado, hold it securely but gently with the fingertips
of your guiding hand. Insert a knife blade into the bottom of the avocado. Turn the avocado
against the knife blade to make a cut completely around it. The cut should pierce the skin and
cut through the flesh up to the pit.
Peel the avocado and cut it lengthwise into wedges or slices. To dice the avocado,
cut crosswise through the wedges. The flesh is soft enough to purée easily when
properly ripened.

1

Twist the two halves of a sliced avocado away from each other and pull gently to
separate them.

2

Since it can be difficult to pick out the pit with your fingertips without mangling the flesh,
scoop it out with a spoon, removing as little flesh as possible, or carefully chop the heel
of the knife into the pit, then twist and pull the pit free from the flesh. To remove the pit
from the knife safely, use the edge of the cutting board or the lip of a container to pry
the pit free.

3

To peel the avocado, catch the skin between the ball of your thumb and the flat side of a
knife blade and pull it free from the flesh.

WORKING WITH DRIED VEGETABLES
AND FRUITS
Dried vegetables and fruits have always been used in many cuisines. Drying makes foods
suitable for long-­term storage and concentrates their flavors.
Even today, some vegetables and fruits are too perishable to transport great distances, or
they have a very short season. The rest of the year, they can be found only in a preserved
form. The flavor of dried chiles, mushrooms, tomatoes, and fruits such as apples, cherries,
and raisins are special even though those same ingredients may be purchased fresh
throughout the year.
To get the most from these ingredients, recipes may often call for them to be rehydrated
or “plumped” by soaking them in a liquid. To rehydrate dried vegetables and fruits, check
first for insect infestation and remove any obvious debris or seriously blemished or moldy
specimens.
Place the vegetable or fruit in a bowl or other container and add enough boiling or very hot
liquid (water, wine, fruit juice, or broth) to cover. Let the vegetable or fruit steep in the hot
water for several minutes, until soft and plumped. Pour off the liquid, reserving it, if desired,
for use in another preparation. If necessary, strain it through a coffee filter or cheesecloth to
remove any debris.
Other dried fruits and vegetables may be toasted or charred in a flame or on a griddle or
heated pan to soften them. Some may be toasted and then rehydrated.
Toast dried chiles in the same manner as dried spices, nuts, and seeds, by tossing them in
a dry skillet over medium heat. Alternatively, pass them repeatedly through a flame until
toasted and softened. Break or cut open the chile and shake out the seeds. Scrape the
pulp and seeds from the skin or use the whole chile, according to the recipe. After toasting,
rehydrate the chile in a hot liquid.

GENERAL GUIDELINES
FOR VEGETABLE AND HERB
MISE EN PLACE
One of the ways to distinguish a novice from a seasoned chef is the way each one approaches
the task of cutting vegetables and herbs. The goal is consistency and speed. Without practice,
it is impossible to achieve either.
To better approach vegetable mise en place, start by figuring out the proper timing of the
work. Make a list and prioritize tasks so that foods that can be prepared well in advance
are done first, while those that lose flavor or color when cut too early are done as close to
service or cooking time as possible. Making such a list involves knowledge of the menu, of
time estimates for the meal periods (if known) for which the vegetables are being cut, and of
standard kitchen practices for holding cut vegetables.

242 | TOOLS AND INGREDIENTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL KITCHEN

Think out the work carefully before beginning. Assemble all the tools needed, including
containers to hold unprepped vegetables, prepped vegetables, usable trim, and trim that is
not useful. Assemble the peelers, knives, and steel. Hone the knives (including the paring
knife) at the start and during the work.
Wash vegetables and herbs before doing any initial trim work to avoid getting the work
surface unnecessarily dirty. Spin dry leafy greens and herbs before you cut them.
Arrange the work in a logical flow, so that things are positioned within easy reach. This makes
the work easier, faster, less wasteful, and more comfortable.
Keep all tools and your work surface clean and free from debris. Remove trim as it
accumulates, before it has a chance to fall on the floor. Wipe down knife blades and cutting
boards between phases of work. Sanitize all cutting and work surfaces when you switch
from one food item to another. Wash your hands, too, and remember to use gloves if the
vegetables will not be cooked before being served to guests.

STOCKS, SAUCES,
AND SOUPS

CHAPTER 12

MISE EN PLACE
Mise en place is the foundation of a
successful kitchen, and preparation
is key to the execution of every
technique and recipe in this book.
Beyond knife cuts and organization,
mise en place includes the
preparation of everyday, frequently
used items, like seasoning blends,
stuffings, house-­prepared pantry
items, and stocks that are needed
on hand. These techniques and
ingredients are the toolkit chefs use
to create new dishes.

MIREPOIX AND AROMATICS
Onions, carrots, celery (both pascal and celeriac), leeks, parsnips, garlic, tomatoes, shallots,
mushrooms, peppers, and ginger are among the ingredients commonly referred to as aromatics.
They may be used in various combinations, as dictated by the cuisine and the dish itself.
The most commonly used aromatics in Western cuisine are onion, carrot, and celery. This
combination is known as mirepoix, and it is the base for most stocks, soups, sauces, stews,
and braises. Even when used in relatively small amounts, aromatic ingredients make a
significant contribution to a dish. For example, 1 lb/454 g of mirepoix is enough to flavor
1 gal/3.84 L of stock, soup, sauce, stew, braise, or marinade.

248 | MISE EN PLACE, STOCKS, SAUCES, AND SOUPS

To get the best flavor from mirepoix and similar preparations, thoroughly rinse and trim all
the vegetables first. Onion skin will give a simmering liquid an orange or a yellow tint, which
may not be desirable, so determine whether to peel onions. Scrubbing, but not peeling,
carrots and parsnips can cut down on the prep time. Nevertheless, some chefs peel all
vegetables on the premise that flavor is extracted into the dish more easily; others peel them
only when they are not strained out of the finished dish.
Whether or not the vegetables are peeled, cut them into pieces of a relatively uniform size,
with the dimensions matched to the cooking time of the dish. The shorter the simmering
time, the smaller and thinner the cut; the longer the time, the larger and thicker the cut. Make
larger cuts for long-­simmering dishes such as pot roasts or brown veal stock. Cut mirepoix
small or slice it for use in uncooked marinades, pan gravies, and dishes that simmer up to
three hours. Slice mirepoix very fine for fumets and stocks that simmer less than one hour.
Mirepoix will add a distinct aroma to a dish, even if the cut-­up vegetables are simply added to
the pot as it simmers. Sweating, smothering, roasting, or browning them in fat significantly
changes their flavor. Start by cooking onions in just enough fat to coat the bottom of the pan
and vegetables, then add the carrots, and finally the celery.
White stocks or cream soups generally call for cooking the mirepoix over low heat in fat until
it starts to give off some of its own natural moisture, known as sweating. If the pot is covered
as the aromatics sweat, the technique is smothering.

chapter 12 • MISE EN PLACE | 249

Pinçage
Pinçage is a technique derived from the French pincer, “to stiffen or pinch”; this term
describes what happens to tomatoes as they cook in hot fat. For pinçage, tomato paste or
other tomato product is added to an already browned mirepoix and cooked until it turns
reddish brown. This step adds acidity and depth of flavor to sauces, soups, and braises.

Brown the onions and carrots, then add the celery. Mirepoix can cook until it turns a deep
rich brown (sometimes referred to as caramelized), either on the range or in the oven.
Start by cooking onions in just enough fat to coat the bottom of the pan and vegetables,

Bouquets, Sachets, and Oignon Brûlé
Bouquet garni, sachet d’épices, and oignon brûlé are three basic aromatic preparations called
for again and again in recipes. These combinations of aromatic vegetables, herbs, and spices
are meant to enhance and support the flavors of a dish. They add flavor to stocks, sauces, and
soups by gently infusing the liquid with their aroma.
All three of these aromatic preparations are added during the cooking process. Bouquets and
sachets are typically tied together for easy removal during cooking, after the desired amount of
flavor has been extracted, even before all the other ingredients in a dish are finished cooking.
A bouquet garni is made up of fresh herbs and vegetables tied into a bundle. If leek is used
to wrap the other bouquet garni ingredients, it must be thoroughly rinsed of dirt first. Cut a
piece of string long enough to leave a tail to tie the bouquet to the pot handle. This makes it
easy to pull out the bouquet when it is time to remove it.

chapter 12 • MISE EN PLACE | 251

A sachet contains ingredients such as peppercorns, other spices, and herbs. The seasonings
are often tied up in a cheesecloth bag for recipes that are not strained after cooking. A “loose”
sachet, for which the sachet ingredients are added directly to a recipe without first being tied,
may be used when the liquid will be strained after the dish has finished cooking.
A standard bouquet or sachet can be modified a little (add some carrot or a garlic clove) or
a lot (use cardamom, ginger, or cinnamon) to produce different effects. A sachet infuses a
liquid with flavor, in the same way that a tea bag is used to make a cup of tea.
For a small batch of less than a gallon, add the sachet or bouquet in the last 15–30 minutes.
For batches of several gallons or more, add it about 1 hour before the end of the cooking
time. Consult specific recipes and formulas for guidance. When you add a bouquet or sachet
to a stock or soup, taste the dish before and after adding it to learn its effect on the dish’s
flavor profile. If the aromatics have been combined following a basic formula and simmered
long enough to infuse the dish with their aroma, the dish should be flavored—­but not
overwhelmed—­by them.
Oignon brûlé (“burnt onion”) and oignon piqué (“pricked” or “studded onion”) are flavoring
ingredients based on whole, halved, or quartered onions. An oignon brûlé is made by peeling
and halving an onion and charring the cut faces in a dry skillet. It is used in some stocks and
consommés to provide golden brown color. An oignon piqué is prepared by studding an onion
with a few whole cloves and a bay leaf. It is used to flavor béchamel sauce and some soups.

THICKENERS
Roux
A roux is a paste made by cooking flour in fat, used to thicken sauces, soups, and stews,
and lend those dishes a special flavor. Cooking flour in fat inactivates an enzyme that, if not
destroyed by high heat, interferes with flour’s thickening ability. Cooking flour also changes
the flour’s raw cereal taste to a toasty or nutty flavor. Both the flavor and the color become
deeper the longer the roux cooks.
In addition to improving raw flour’s flavor and color, cooking flour in fat helps to keep the
starch in the flour from forming long strands or clumps when the roux is combined with a
liquid. However, keep in mind that the same weight of white roux has more thickening power
than a darker roux, because the browning process causes some of the starch in the flour
to break down, making it unavailable for thickening. Therefore, the darker the roux, the less
thickening power it has.
Although other thickeners are gradually supplanting roux in the American kitchen for
various reasons (including the longer cooking time required to remove any taste of raw flour
and because it creates a heavier sauce), it is still used extensively, perhaps because of its
European culinary heritage and its several distinct advantages. In addition to thickening a
dish, roux will change the color of a sauce and, if a dark roux is used, lend it a nutty or toasted
flavor. For example, dark roux is particularly important in Creole and Cajun cuisines, where it
gives gumbos and stews their unique character. Another advantage of using roux is that the
starches present in the flour do not break down as easily as some others, creating a more
stable sauce.
chapter 12 • MISE EN PLACE | 253

• Roux can be prepared with any type of white wheat flour; however, the most desirable
is all-­purpose flour due to its starch content. Flours vary in their starch-­to-­protein ratio.
Cake flour, for instance, has a higher proportion of starch to protein than bread flour and
will, therefore, have more thickening power than a bread flour roux. All-­purpose flour has
a thickening power between the two. Roux called for in this book was tested using all-­
purpose flour.
• Clarified butter (page 258) is the most common fat used for making roux, but whole butter,
vegetable oils, rendered chicken fat, or other rendered fats may also be used. Each fat will
influence the finished dish’s flavor.
• Heat the fat over medium heat and add the flour, stirring to combine. The basic formula for
a roux is 60 percent flour to 40 percent fat (by weight). The roux should be very smooth
and moist, with a glossy sheen—­not dry or greasy. It should look like “sand at low tide.”
Adjust the roux’s texture by adding more flour or fat. Stir the roux as it cooks to keep it
from roux scorching, and continue to cook it to the desired color. To reduce the chances of
scorching, large quantities of roux may be placed in a moderate oven (350° to 375°F/
177° to 191°C) to complete cooking.
• The four basic colors of roux are white (barely colored or chalky), blond (golden straw color
with a slightly nutty aroma), brown (deep brown with a strong nutty aroma), and dark (dark
brown with a pronounced nutty flavor and aroma). Once the roux is cooked to its desired
doneness, it is ready to use, or it may be cooled and stored for later.

Roux (from left to right): white, blond, brown, dark

Roux can be combined with liquid in three ways. Cool roux may be added to hot liquid,
cool liquid may be added to hot roux, or warm roux may be added to liquid of the same
temperature. For any approach, though, follow these general guidelines:

1

Avoid temperature extremes to prevent lumping.

2

Cool or room temperature roux can be incorporated into hot liquid more easily than ice-­
cold roux because the fat is not as solid.

3

Very cold liquid should not be used, as it will initially cause the roux to harden.

4

Extremely hot roux should be avoided, because it may spatter when combined with a
liquid and cause serious burns.

The full thickening action of the roux becomes evident when the liquid has reached
approximately 200°F/93°C. Long-­cooking sauces and soups are further thickened through
reduction.

254 | MISE EN PLACE, STOCKS, SAUCES, AND SOUPS

Pure Starch Slurries
Arrowroot, cornstarch, and other pure starches have greater thickening power,
ounce for ounce, than flour and do not require an extended simmering time like
roux. They also lend much less color or none at all to a final dish. However, keep
in mind that they break down more quickly over time than does roux.
Arrowroot, cornstarch, tapioca, potato starch, and rice flour are all pure
starches. They are made into slurries by dispersing them in cold liquid.
Thoroughly blend the starch and liquid to about the consistency of heavy
cream. Slurries can be blended in advance and held to use during à la minute
preparations. If not used immediately, the starch will settle out of the liquid and
fall to the bottom of the container. Stir the slurry just before use to recombine
the starch evenly with the liquid.
Pour or ladle the slurry into simmering liquid while stirring constantly. When
added in this way, slurries quickly thicken the liquid, making it easy for the chef
to control the final consistency of the dish. Whisk constantly to prevent lumping
and scorching. Bring the liquid back to a boil and cook just until the sauce
reaches the desired thickness and clarity.
Dishes thickened with slurries have limited holding periods. Be sure to check
periodically for quality if they must be held in a steam table. Various starches
have somewhat different qualities but may be substituted one for the other,
following the formula on the next page.

COMMON THICKENING STARCHES AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS

TO SUBSTITUTE A PURE STARCH FOR ROUX

the following formula:

Tapioca/Cassava flour: 0.4

Weight of flour in roux [multiply weight of roux by 0.6 to determine

Potato starch: 0.2

weight of flour] × Thickening power of replacement starch [see chart] =
Estimated weight of replacement starch required

EXAMPLE:
To substitute arrowroot in a recipe that calls for 10 oz/284 g of roux:
10 oz/284 g roux × 0.6 = 6 oz/170 g flour
6 oz/170 g flour × 0.5 [arrowroot thickening power] = 3 oz/85 g
arrowroot

Liaison
The mixture of egg yolks and cream that is used to enrich and slightly thicken
sauces and soups is called a liaison. A liaison is not a thickener in the same way
that roux and pure starch slurries are, but the combination of cream and eggs,
when properly simmered in a dish, adds sheen, smoothness, body, and flavor
as well as a light golden-­ivory color.
Egg yolks normally begin to coagulate at 149°F/65°C. The addition of cream
raises the coagulation point to 180° to 185°F/82° to 85°C. Mix the cream and egg

CLARIFIED BUTTER
Clarified butter is made by heating whole butter until the butterfat and milk solids separate.
The purpose of clarifying butter is to remove its milk solids and water. This makes it possible
to cook with butter at a higher temperature than is possible with whole butter. Clarified
butter is commonly used to make roux. Because it adds some butter flavor, it is often used
for sautéing, sometimes in combination with vegetable oil. Some chefs also prefer it for warm
butter sauces such as hollandaise and béarnaise. Ghee, which is used in some Asian cuisines,
is a type of clarified butter. It has a nutty flavor because the milk solids are allowed to brown
before they are separated from the butterfat.
When whole butter is clarified, some of its volume is lost during skimming and decanting:
1 lb/454 g of butter will yield approximately 12 oz/340 g of clarified butter.
Using salted butter for clarifying is not recommended because the concentration of salt in
the resulting clarified butter is unpredictable. Unsalted clarified butter can always be salted
as it’s used.

The remaining butterfat becomes very clear. Skim the
surface foam as the butter clarifies using a ladle, screen
skimmer, or perforated spoon.

SEASONINGS
Adding seasonings at the proper point in the cooking process is key to giving a finished dish
the fullest possible flavor. The array of seasonings runs from simple to complex blends of
herbs and spices, and marinades that may include oils, acids, and aromatics such as onions,
garlic, fresh or dried herbs, or spices. In every case, though, seasonings are meant to enhance
flavor, not detract from or overwhelm the dish. Liquid marinades may change the texture of
foods in addition to flavoring them.
Salt and pepper are taken so much for granted that some beginning cooks fail to apply these
two seasonings early enough during cooking or in enough quantity to bring out the best flavor
in cooked foods. Salt and pepper added before cooking bring out the inherent flavors in foods.
If these seasonings are added only after the cooking is complete, the salt and pepper may
take on too much significance in the finished dish’s flavor. It is generally better to apply salt
chapter 12 • MISE EN PLACE | 259

and pepper separately. Using your fingertips to apply
salt and pepper is a good way to control the amount
added and to apply a more even coat.
Salt and pepper are fundamental, but blends that
combine various spices, herbs, and other aromatics can
create a particular flavor profile. Like salt and pepper,
they may be applied directly to raw meat, poultry, or fish.
To intensify the flavor of seeds and spices, toast them
either on the stovetop or in a moderate oven just before
grinding. Be sure to pay close attention. They can go from
perfectly toasted to scorched very quickly.
To toast seeds or spices in the oven, spread them out on
a dry sheet pan in a moderate oven just until a pleasant
aroma is apparent. Stir often to ensure even browning.
Remove immediately and transfer to a fresh pan or
plate to cool.
To toast spices and seeds on the stovetop, spread them
in a shallow layer in a preheated dry sauté pan and toss,
shake, or swirl the pan until a rich, penetrating aroma
arises. Transfer them to a cool pan to avoid scorching.
Fresh herbs and other ingredients such as garlic,
Toasting seeds and spices on the stovetop

fresh or dry bread crumbs, or grated cheeses can be
blended into a paste or coating. They are sometimes moistened with
oil, prepared mustard, or similar ingredients to create a texture that can
easily adhere to a food or make it easier to blend it into a dish as a final
seasoning. Fresh herbs may have dirt in their leaves, so rinse them well
to remove sand or grit. Thorough drying improves the flavor and texture
of the blend by preventing water clinging to the herb’s leaves from
diluting flavor.
When a spice blend is used as a dry rub (also called a dry marinade) to
coat food, the food is refrigerated after application to allow it to absorb
the flavors. Very often, these rubs contain some salt to help intensify all
the flavors in the dish. Dry rubs may be left on the food during cooking
or they may be scraped away first. Spice blends may also be added to
aromatic vegetables as they cook during the initial stages of preparing a
braise or stew. The fat used to cook the vegetables releases the flavor of
the spices and infuses the dish more effectively than if the spice blend
were simply added to a simmering dish. Barbecued beef and Jamaican
jerked pork are classic examples of dishes that may be prepared using
a dry rub.

Marinades
Marinades generally contain one or more of the following: oil, acid, and
aromatics (spices, herbs, and vegetables). Oils protect food from intense
heat during cooking and help hold other flavorful ingredients in contact
with the food. Acids, such as vinegar, wine, yogurt, and citrus juices,
flavor the food and change its texture. In some cases, acids firm or stiffen
foods (e.g., the lime juice marinade that “cooks” the raw fish in ceviche).
Marinating times vary according to the food’s texture. Tender or delicate
foods such as fish or poultry breasts require less time. A tougher cut of
meat may be marinated for days. The ratio of acid to other ingredients
may also affect timing. High-­acid marinades, such as those used to
prepare seviche, produce the desired effect within 15 or 20 minutes of
applying them to a food. Others are best left in contact with foods for
several hours, while some require several days.
Some marinades are cooked before use; others are not. Sometimes the
marinade is used to flavor an accompanying sauce or may itself become
a dipping sauce. Marinades that have been in contact with raw foods can
be used in these ways provided that they are boiled for several minutes
first to kill any lingering pathogens.
To use a liquid marinade, add it to the ingredient and turn the ingredient

to coat evenly. Cover and marinate, refrigerated, for the length of time
indicated by the recipe, the type of meat, poultry, or fish, and the desired result.
Brush or scrape off excess marinade before cooking and pat dry, particularly if
the marinade contains herbs or other aromatics that burn easily.

PICKLING VEGETABLES
Pickling is a technique that preserves food by brining it or packing it in
vinegar. The process tenderizes the food slightly, but the finished pickles
maintain a crisp texture and a characteristic sour flavor that has become
a pantry staple.
Choose fresh, ripe vegetables for pickling. Avoid produce with spoilage,
dark spots, or bruising. Additionally, overripe vegetables may become
mushy when pickled. Wash and dry the vegetables carefully before
beginning any preparation. Use the exact type of produce referenced in a
recipe, as many items do not pickle well. Trim the ends off of vegetables,
especially cucumbers. The end of a vegetable that was attached to the
plant can contain various enzymes that can affect the texture of the
finished pickled product and/or lead to spoilage. In addition, be sure to use
unwaxed produce—­any produce with a wax coating will not properly pickle.
Vegetables are not the only foods that can be successfully pickled—­
many varieties of fruit make delicious pickles. Choose firm, ripe (but
not overripe) fruits, as the pickling process will tenderize the flesh
somewhat. You may want to pretreat the fruit to prevent discoloration.

Pickled vegetables, like these beets, can be used to
top salads and other cold dishes, and to add a bright,
acidic element to any dish
chapter 12 • MISE EN PLACE | 261

FLAVORED OILS AND VINEGARS
Good-­quality oils and vinegars can be infused with spices,
aromatics, herbs, and fruits or vegetables. Flavored oils and
vinegars work well as condiments, or as a drizzle or droplets on a
plated dish to add a bit of intense flavor and color. They are also
excellent to use as dressings for vegetables, pastas, grains, or fruits.
And of course, they can be used in vinaigrettes and other dressings
for a special effect.
To flavor oils and vinegars, use one of the following methods:
• Heat the oil or vinegar very gently over low heat. The flavoring
ingredients, such as citrus zest or garlic, may be added to the oil
or vinegar as it warms. Let the oil or vinegar steep off the heat
with the flavoring ingredients until cool, then pour into storage
bottles or containers.
• Heat the oil or vinegar without any added flavorings, then pour
it over the flavoring ingredients and cool. Pour the infused oil or
vinegar into storage containers.
• Purée raw, blanched or fully cooked vegetables, herbs, or
fruits. Bring the purée to a simmer, reducing it if necessary
to concentrate flavors. Add the purée to the oil or vinegar
and transfer to a storage container. Leave the oil or vinegar
as is and use it like a purée, or strain it to remove the
fibers and pulp.
• Combine room-temperature oils or vinegars with ground spices
and transfer them to a storage container. Let the mixture sit until

occasionally and, if necessary, strain or decant it into a clean bottle.

Use within a few days for the best flavor and color.

STANDARD BREADING PROCEDURE
Breading is done to create a crisp crust on fried foods. It is prepared by coating foods with
flour, egg wash, and bread crumbs or other coatings. The standard breading procedure is the
most efficient way to coat a number of items, using a consistent sequence.
Be sure to season the food before applying any coating.
Use flour and similar meals or powders, such as cornstarch, to lightly dredge or dust foods
before they are dipped in an egg wash.
Make an egg wash by blending eggs (whole, yolks, or whites) and water or milk. A general
guideline calls for about 2 fl oz/60 mL milk for every 2 whole eggs. Some items are dipped
into milk or buttermilk before they are breaded, rather than in egg wash.
Bread crumbs may be dry or fresh. Fresh white bread crumbs (called mie de pain in French)
are prepared by grating or processing finely textured bread, such as white Pullman bread
with the crust removed. Dry bread crumbs are prepared from slightly stale bread that may be
further dried or toasted in a warm oven. Panko (Japanese bread crumbs) bread crumbs are
coarser than standard bread crumbs and create a crunchy crust when fried.
262 | MISE EN PLACE, STOCKS, SAUCES, AND SOUPS

The standard breading set-­up

Other ingredients may be used in place of or in addition to bread crumbs. Options include
nuts, seeds, shredded coconut, cornflakes, potato flakes, shredded potatoes, grated cheese,
ground spices, garlic paste, and chopped herbs.
Blot the food dry with paper towels and season as desired. Hold it in one hand and dip it in
flour. Shake off any excess flour and transfer the food to the container of egg wash. Switch
hands, pick up the food, and turn it if necessary to coat it on all sides. Transfer it to the
container of bread crumbs. Use your dry hand to pack bread crumbs evenly around the food.
Shake off any excess, then transfer the food to a rack set over a holding tray. Store breaded
food in single layers, but if you must stack the pieces, use parchment or waxed paper to
separate the layers.
Discard any unused flour, egg wash, and bread crumbs. The presence of juices, drippings, or
particles of the food you just coated will contaminate these products, making them unsafe
for use with other foods. Even sifting the flour or crumbs or straining the egg wash will not be
sufficient to prevent cross contamination and eliminate the potential for food-­borne illness.

Stuffings
Stuffings add flavor, moisture, and texture to a dish. The simplest stuffings are made from
only herbs, vegetables, and fruits; options include quartered or halved onions, garlic cloves,
lemons or oranges, and sprigs or bunches of fresh herbs. Although these are uncomplicated,
they can have a dramatic impact on flavor.
Bread and particularly forcemeat stuffings are more complex options. Prepare bread
stuffings by cubing or breaking breads (peasant-­style, corn, French, or Italian-­style) into
small pieces. Stuffings are generally flavored with aromatic vegetables (typically cooked in
some fat to develop their flavor), herbs, and spices. Some bread stuffings are moistened with
stocks or broths. Optionally, eggs may be included to bind the stuffing. Additional ingredients,
such as cooked sausage, seafood, or mushrooms, may also be included.

chapter 12 • MISE EN PLACE | 263

Grain-­based stuffings are based upon rice, barley, kasha, or other grains that have been
cooked until just tender (use the pilaf or simmering methods; see pages 648 and 640). Once
cooked, cool the grains completely before the stuffing is added to meat, poultry, or fish.
These stuffings can be seasoned, moistened, and bound similarly to bread-­based stuffings.
Forcemeat stuffings are often used to fill delicate cuts of meat and fish (e.g., to spread
onto fish fillets before they are rolled into paupiettes and shallow-­poached; see page 566).
These mixtures must be handled carefully to keep them well chilled and wholesome. Keep
forcemeats over an ice bath for quality as well as food safety.
Another important consideration with stuffings, along with flavor and quality, is proper
handling for food safety. Any stuffing ingredients that require precooking should be cooled to
below 40°F/4°C before they are combined with other stuffing elements. The finished mixture
should also be chilled well before stuffing. During final cooking, stuffings must reach the
minimum safe temperature for the food they were stuffed into. Stuffing in a chicken breast
or leg, for instance, must reach 165°F/74°C. For this reason, whole chickens and turkeys
are rarely stuffed in professional kitchens. By the time the stuffing reaches the necessary
temperature, the meat would be overcooked. Instead, stuffings for whole roasted birds are
more often baked separately, in which case they are known as dressings.

GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR
DETERMINING DONENESS IN
MEATS, POULTRY, AND FISH
Chefs must rely not only on a thermometer but also on their senses when cooking. Those
senses are put to a greater test in determining doneness in à la minute cooking because
chefs can’t actually taste what they are serving, the way they can taste a soup or a sauce.
Follow these guidelines:
• The way it smells. As foods near doneness, their smells change. Aromas intensify and
become easier to identify. Each cooking method produces a particular aroma. Grilled and
broiled foods should have a pleasing smoky, charred aroma, indicating rich, deep flavor.
• The way it feels. Foods should be easy to cut and chew. Touch foods (with a gloved finger)
to gauge resistance. The less well-­done a piece of meat is, the softer and more yielding it
will feel. Keep in mind that texture varies in different cuts of meat.
• The way it looks. As meat cooks, the exterior will change color. The interior colors also
change, an important factor when determining doneness in meats cooked to customer
preference (rare, medium, or well done). If the meat appears pale or even gray, it has not
been properly cooked. The juices that run from the meat, although minimal, should be the
correct color; the rarer the meat, the redder the juices will appear.
Appearance is also an important factor in knowing when to turn a piece of meat. When the
meat’s upper surface begins to appear very moist (there may even be moisture beads), the
meat should be turned. Thin pieces may start to change color at the edges when they are
ready for turning.

The temperatures in the following table are final resting temperatures, based on the USDA’s
safe cooking guidelines. Most meats, poultry, and fish need to be removed from the pan, grill,
or oven before they reach their final temperature to avoid overcooking and drying out. Heat
is retained by foods even after they are removed from the heat source. That residual heat
causes the food to keep cooking, a phenomenon referred to as carryover cooking. Internal
temperatures taken just as the food is removed from the oven and again after resting will
show a temperature difference of anywhere from a few degrees to ten, fifteen, or more.
Factors that play a role in changes in internal temperature during resting include the mass of
the food being prepared and the presence or absence of stuffing and bones.

STOCKS
Stocks are among the most basic preparations found in any professional kitchen. In fact,
they are referred to in French as fonds de cuisine, the “foundations of cooking.” A stock is a
flavorful liquid prepared by simmering meaty bones from meat or poultry, seafood, and/or
vegetables in water with aromatics until their flavor, aroma, color, body, and nutritive value
are extracted. The liquid is then used to prepare sauces and soups, and as a braising and
simmering cooking medium for vegetables and grains.
• White stocks, brown stocks, and fumets are the three basic types of stock. White stocks are
made by combining all of the ingredients with a cool liquid (typically water) and simmering
over gentle heat. Brown stocks are made by browning the bones and mirepoix in enough fat
to produce a rich mahogany color, either by roasting in the oven or on the stovetop, before
simmering. Fumets (sometimes known as essences) call for sweating or smothering the
main ingredients before simmering, often with the addition of dry white wine.
• For good flavor and body, use meaty bones and fish bones. They can be acquired as a
by-­product of meat and fish fabrication or purchased solely for stock. Bones from younger
animals contain a high percentage of cartilage and other connective tissues that break
down into gelatin during simmering and give the stock body. Knuckle, back, and neck
bones are good for stock as well. Include any wholesome trim from fabrication, if available,
to further bolster flavor. Cut bones into 3-­in/8-­cm lengths for quicker and more thorough
extraction of flavor, gelatin, and nutritive value. If bones are purchased frozen, thaw them
before simmering for stock.
• Rinse all bones, fresh or frozen, thoroughly before putting them into the stockpot, to
remove blood and other impurities that can compromise the quality of the stock. For
brown stocks, prepare the bones and trim by roasting them first. Trim and cut mirepoix
to a size that will allow for good flavor extraction. A 2-­in/5-­cm rough cut or slice is good
for a simmering time of one hour. Cut vegetables larger or smaller for longer or shorter
simmering times. The mirepoix and tomato paste called for in brown stocks are roasted or
sautéed until browned before they are added to the stock.
• Stocks also include a sachet d’épices or bouquet garni containing aromatics suited to
the type of stock being made. Because the stock will eventually be strained, some chefs
do not tie up sachet or bouquet ingredients. However, tying makes it easy to remove the
aromatics if their flavor becomes too strong.
• The flavor of the stock can be changed or deepened depending on the ingredients used.
Certain stocks generally use basic mirepoix combinations, but more ingredients can be
added to produce the desired flavor. This is also true of the standard bouquet garni and
sachet d’épices, whose ingredients can be expanded to produce deeper and more varied
flavors. Add or replace aromatic ingredients to achieve a particular flavor. For example,
juniper berries can be added to game bird stocks along with strongly flavored herbs, such
as tarragon or rosemary, or wild mushroom stems. Since these ingredients are very strong,
use discretion when adding so as not to over-­flavor the stock.

chapter 12 • MISE EN PLACE | 271

Pots used for stocks are usually taller than they are wide. This type of pot creates a
smaller surface area so the evaporation rate is minimized during simmering. Some stockpots
have spigots at the bottom that can be used to remove the finished stock without disturbing
the bones. Court bouillons, fumets, and essences that do not have long simmering times can
be prepared in rondeaus or other wide, shallow pots. Tilting or steam-­jacketed kettles are
often used for large-­scale production.

Stock pot

• Ladles or skimmers should be on hand to remove scum from the stock as it simmers.
Cheesecloth, sieves, and colanders are used to separate the bones and vegetables from
the stock. A thermometer and metal containers for cooling, as well as plastic containers for
storing the stock, should be on hand. Tasting spoons will also be needed.
• For a healthier option: Stock is an excellent way to infuse flavor into a dish without adding
fat. Use it to cook grains, vegetables, meats, sauces, or soups.

chapter 12 • MISE EN PLACE | 275

Method in Detail
1

Combine the bones with cool liquid to cover by two inches and bring them slowly to
a simmer in an appropriate size stockpot. Skim as necessary. For the best flavor and
clearest stock, start with a cool liquid to gently extract flavor and body. Maintain a bare
simmer throughout the cooking process. Bubbles should break the surface of the stock
infrequently.

2

Skim the liquid consistently to produce a clear stock, and regulate the proper
temperature. Apart from the aesthetics of a clear stock, the impurities that leave a stock
cloudy are the same elements that will quickly spoil and sour a stock. Therefore, the
clearer the stock, the longer its shelf life.

3

Add the mirepoix to the stock at the appropriate time to extract the maximum amount
of flavor. The right time to add mirepoix to all stocks except fish stocks, fumets, and
court bouillons is about two hours before the end of cooking time. Adding mirepoix at
this point will allow enough time for the best flavor to be extracted but not so much
time that the flavor is broken down and destroyed. Other aromatics, such as a sachet
d’épices or bouquet garni, should be added in the last 30–45 minutes of cooking. Since
fish stocks, fumets, essences, and court bouillons do not have extended cooking times,
the mirepoix ingredients are normally cut smaller and added near the beginning of the
simmering time, and they remain in the stock throughout cooking.

Note for Fish Stock: Combine the bones with the cool water and aromatics and simmer gently for
35–45 minutes. This is sometimes called the swimming method, to distinguish it from fumet made by the
sweating method.
Note for Fish Fumet: Sweat the mirepoix and mushrooms, followed by the fish bones prior to adding the water.

4

Add a sachet about 45 minutes before the stock has finished simmering to obtain the
most flavor. Simmer until the desired flavor, aroma, body, and color are achieved. Smell
and taste the stock as it develops so that you can begin to understand its stages and
notice when it has reached its peak. Once the stock reaches that point, further cooking
will cause flavors to become flat. Even the color of the stock may be slightly off if it
simmers too long.

5

Strain the stock and use it immediately or cool it properly. Pour or ladle the stock out of
the pot through a fine-­mesh sieve or a colander lined with rinsed cheesecloth. Disturb
the solid ingredients as little as possible for the clearest stock. Once you have removed
as much stock as possible by ladling, drain the remaining stock through a colander
into a bowl. Then strain the stock through cheesecloth or a fine-­mesh sieve to remove
any remaining impurities, if desired. Reserve the bones and mirepoix to prepare a
remouillage, if desired.

6

Cool the stock over an ice bath, stirring frequently, until it reaches 40°F/4°C, if not using
immediately. Skim any fat that rises to the surface or wait until it has hardened under
refrigeration and simply lift it away before reheating the stock for later use.

Quality Criteria for Stocks
• Properly prepared stocks have a well-­balanced, rich, and full-­bodied flavor, with the major
flavoring ingredient dominating and the flavors of the aromatics unobtrusive.
• The color will be clear and light golden for white stocks and deep amber and brown for
brown stocks. Vegetable stocks will vary in color according to the main ingredient.

General Guidelines for Stocks
Making stocks takes both time and money. If your kitchen prepares stocks, you should be
sure you follow the correct procedures for cooling and storing them. Select a stock to use in
a dish based upon either recipe requirements or the effect you hope to achieve, and always
check a stock before using it to make sure it is still flavorful and wholesome. Boil a small
amount and taste it. The aroma should be appealing, not overly pungent or sour.

Remouillage
Translated from the French as “rewetting,” remouillage is made by reserving the simmered
bones and mirepoix from a stock and simmering them a second time. Remouillage may also
be made from the clarification raft used to prepare consommé. This secondary stock of
weaker strength can be used as the liquid for stocks and broths or as a cooking medium, or
reduced to a glace.

Glace
Glace is a highly reduced stock or remouillage. As a result of continued reduction, the stock
acquires a jelly-­like or syrupy consistency and its flavor is highly concentrated. When chilled,
a glace becomes rubbery because of the high concentration of gelatin. Glaces are used to
boost the flavor of other foods, particularly sauces.
When they are reconstituted with water, they may also serve as a sauce base in much the
same way as a commercially prepared base. Glaces are made from different kinds of stock;
the most common is glace de viande, made from brown veal stock, beef stock, or remouillage.

Commercial Bases
Not all kitchens prepare stocks today, either because meaty bones and trim are not readily
available on a consistent basis or because they do not have the space or staff to successfully
prepare and hold stocks. Commercially prepared bases are then used in place of stocks. Even
in kitchens that do prepare stocks, bases are helpful to have on hand to deepen and improve
the stock’s flavor.
Bases are available in highly reduced forms (similar to the classic glace de viande) and
dehydrated (powdered or cubed). Not all bases are created equal, however. Read the labels
carefully. Avoid bases that rely on high-­sodium ingredients for flavor. Quality bases are
made from meats, bones, vegetables, spices, and aromatics. Prepare them according to the
package instructions and taste each one. Judge the base on its flavor, saltiness, balance,
and depth.
After deciding that a base meets your standards for quality and cost, learn how to make any
adjustments necessary. For example, you might sweat or roast more vegetables and simmer
them in a diluted base, perhaps along with browned trim, to make a rich brown sauce.

1

Condition the roasting pan: Heat the pan with enough oil to lightly film it in a 425° to 450°F/218° to 232°C oven. If
the bones are extremely fatty, no oil is necessary. The fat will render during the roasting process and the pan will be
lubricated. Adding oil at the beginning could be a waste. Spread the bones in the pan and return to the oven. Roast
the bones, stirring and turning from time to time, until they are deep brown, 30–45 minutes.

2

Transfer the bones to a stockpot large enough to accommodate all the ingredients. Add 5 1/2 qt/5.28 L of the water
and bring to a simmer at 180°F/82°C.

3

Discard the excess fat from the roasting pan but reserve some for making the pinçage. Return the roasting pan to the
oven or place it on the range, depending on the stove space available. Caramelize the carrots and onions. When they
have attained a rich brown color, add the celery and cook it until it begins to wilt and shrivel, 10–15 minutes. (Celery
will not brown very much because of its high water content.)

4

Once the proper color of the mirepoix has been attained, add the tomato paste and continue to cook slowly until
the pinçage has a rich brick reddish-­brown color. Once the tomato paste has been cooked, remove the mixture from
the pan. Add the remaining water and deglaze the fond off the bottom of the pan. Reduce the liquid to a syrupy
consistency. It is now ready to be added to the stock.

5

After the stock has simmered for about 5 hours, add the mirepoix mixture, reduced deglazing liquid, and the sachet.

6

Continue to simmer the stock at 180° to 185°F/82° to 85°C, skimming as necessary and tasting from time to time,
until it has developed a rich flavor, noticeable body, and rich brown color, about 1 hour more.

Add ingredients at staggered intervals, according to cooking times. Stir the soup from time to
time throughout the cooking process to prevent starchy ingredients from sticking to the bottom
of the pot and for the best flavor, texture, and appearance. When the flavor is fully developed and
all of the ingredients are tender, the soup may be finished or garnished and served right away, or
cooled and refrigerated. Although some soups develop a more rounded, mellow flavor if served
the day after they are prepared, no soup benefits from hours on the stove. Not only will the flavor
become dull and flat, but the nutritive value will greatly diminish as well.

Adjusting Consistency
Thick soups, especially those made with starchy vegetables or dried beans, may continue to
thicken during cooking, storage, and reheating or holding. As a rule, creams and bisques are
about as thick as cold heavy cream and liquid enough to pour from a ladle into a bowl. Purées
are somewhat thicker.
For a soup that is too thin, a small amount of starch slurry may be added. Have the soup at a
simmer or slow boil when the slurry is added, then stir constantly and continue to simmer for
2 or 3 minutes.

Adjusting Flavor
and Seasoning
Season soups throughout the cooking process. Meat
or poultry glaze may be added to bolster a weak broth
or consommé, but this will affect the clarity. Chopped
fresh herbs, a few drops of lemon juice, Tabasco sauce,
Worcestershire sauce, or grated citrus zest may be added
to brighten a soup’s flavor.

Degreasing
Some soups, especially broth-­based ones, may be
prepared in advance, then cooled and refrigerated. It
is then easy to remove the fat, which congeals on the
surface, before reheating the soup. If the soup is to be
served just after it is prepared, skim as much fat as
possible from the surface. Clear soups may be blotted
with strips of paper towel or unwaxed brown butcher
paper to remove any traces of fat before serving. Float
the strips on the surface, then carefully lift them off.
Consommés should be completely fat free, but broths
and clear vegetable soups characteristically have some
droplets of fat on the surface. It is always best to start
with the smallest amount of fat possible to prevent the
Clear soups may be blotted with strips of paper towel or unwaxed brown

need for excess degreasing.

Finishing
Some soups may be prepared to a specific point and then cooled and refrigerated. Garnish
clear soups just before service to prevent them from becoming cloudy and to keep the
garnish fresh.
Some garnishes are added, portion by portion, to heated cups or bowls just prior to
service. In other cases, such as for buffet service, the garnish may be added to the entire
quantity of soup.
Finish cream and liaison soups just prior to service. Do this for two reasons: The soup will
have a fresher flavor and its shelf life will be longer. Bring cream to a boil before adding it
to soup to check freshness and prevent it from lowering the soup’s temperature. Temper
a liaison to prevent curdling. Make final seasoning adjustments after the soup is finished.
Always check the seasoning immediately before service.

Garnishing
Garnishes may provide contrasts of flavor and texture or they may introduce a
complementary flavor. They may also provide additional or contrasting color. In all cases,
they should be thoughtfully selected, well prepared, and well seasoned.
Shape large garnishes, such as dumplings or wontons, to a size that does not allow them to
overwhelm the soup cup or plate selected for service. It is equally important that they not
be too difficult for the guest to eat. They should be soft
enough to cut through with the edge of a soup spoon.
Since service temperature is extremely important for
all soups, remember to bring the garnish to service
temperature before adding it to the soup. There are
several ways to do this:
• Heat the garnish in a steamer or in a small quantity of
broth or consommé and hold it in a steam table.
• Cut delicate items into shapes that will allow the heat
of the soup to warm them thoroughly. If they are
small and relatively thin, they will not cause the soup’s
temperature to drop too severely.
• Keep large items like dumplings or wontons warm and
lightly moistened in a steam table or on the shelf over the
range, covered to prevent dehydration of the product.

Serving
Hot soups should be served very hot. The thinner the
soup, the more important this is. Since consommés and
broths lose their heat rapidly, they should be nearly at
a boil before they are ladled into heated cups. The more
surface area exposed to the air, the quicker the soup
will cool. This is one reason that consommés and other
broth-­style soups are traditionally served in cups rather
chapter 13 • SOUPS | 289

than in the flatter, wider soup plates or bowls often used for cream soups and purées. Serving
thin soups in cups also makes it easier for servers to transport the soup without spilling. Cold
soups should be thoroughly chilled and served in chilled cups, bowls, or glasses.
Take the time to explain to anyone involved in serving soups the importance of keeping hot
soups very hot and taking them quickly from the kitchen to the guest. Show all servers or
line cooks the way that a soup should look when it is served to the guest, with garnishes and
additional elements such as grated cheese or fine oils to pass or serve at tableside.

Reheating
If a soup has been prepared in advance, reheat only the amount needed for a particular
service period. Maintaining food at high temperatures for extended periods often has
undesirable effects on flavor and texture. One good way to maintain optimum quality and
minimize waste is to reheat individual portions to order. Sometimes, however, this approach
is not practical. Learn the best way to make use of the equipment available for service to
determine how to get foods to service temperature. Getting foods through the danger zone
quickly is important.
Bring clear soup just up to a boil. Check seasoning and consistency and add the appropriate
garnishes before serving. Reheat thick soups gently. Reheat the soup over low heat at first,
stirring frequently until it softens slightly. Then increase the heat slightly and bring the
soup to a simmer. If a soup has already been finished with cream, sour cream, or especially
a liaison, do not let it come all the way up to a boil or it may curdle. A temperature of
180°F/82°C is adequate for both quality and food safety concerns. Check seasoning and
consistency and add any garnishes just before serving.
Check the temperature regularly for soups held in a steam table. If they consistently fall short
of a desirable temperature (at least 165°F/74°C for most soups and sauces), then adjust the
thermostat on the steam table, have it repaired, or learn to compensate by quickly bringing
individual servings to the correct temperature over direct heat or in a microwave.

CONSOMMÉ
Consommé is a clear, pure broth made by combining stock with a clarification mixture.
The mixture forms a raft that traps impurities and clarifies the liquid. The result is flavorful
soup completely free of fat and solids. Consommés are served piping hot, or chilled as a
savory gelatin.
• Consommés are made with stock and a clarification mixture, which consists of lean
ground meat, egg whites, mirepoix, herbs, spices, and an acidic component like tomato
or wine.
• Stock for consommé should be of high quality and very fresh. To check for quality, bring a
small amount to a boil, then smell and taste it. If there is any doubt about the quality of the
stock, use a fresher batch or prepare new stock.

290 | MISE EN PLACE, STOCKS, SAUCES, AND SOUPS

• The clarification ingredients, known as a raft, are a combination of lean ground meat,
egg whites, mirepoix, herbs and spices, and tomato or other acidic ingredients. All of these
ingredients serve multiple functions in preparing a well-­balanced consommé. This mixture
of ingredients produces a crystal-­clear flavorful soup by removing impurities from the
stock and bolstering its flavor.
• Whenever possible, grind the meat along with the mirepoix vegetables for the best flavor
and quality in the finished consommé. Whether or not you grind the meat in-­house, be sure
to keep it and the egg whites refrigerated so that they remain wholesome and flavorful.
• To enhance the flavor and color of a consommé, double the amount of ground meat in the
recipe. This is known as a double consommé.
• Mirepoix vegetables should be cut small or ground so that they become part of the raft
and release their flavors quickly. A variety of aromatic vegetables such as onions, carrots,
celery, garlic, leeks, parsnips, and mushrooms is typical.
• The acidic ingredient, such as tomatoes, is added just before the stock is blended into the
clarification to help the raft form properly, as well as for its flavor. Lemon juice or vinegar is
an acidic option for a fish or vegetable consommé.
• Herbs and spices are also included in the clarification mixture: sprigs or stems of tarragon,
parsley, chervil, dill, thyme, or other fresh herbs; cloves, bay leaves, peppercorns, juniper
berries, or star anise; and ginger and lemongrass. An oignon brûlée (page 253) may also be
included to give additional flavor and color. Other flavoring items are used as necessary to
achieve a special flavor.
• The clarification mixture’s ingredients have to be cold before they’re added, to keep
impurities from emulsifying into the stock. Ingredients should be below 40°F or 4°C at
the start of cooking, so this preparation needs to be done well in advance of making the
consommé. Mix the clarification ingredients (except the acid) thoroughly and if time
permits, chill for several hours or overnight.
• The pot used for preparing consommé should have a heavy bottom to help prevent
the clarification ingredients from sticking and scorching, and it should be taller than it is
wide. The even heat of steam kettles and flattop ranges, if available, are ideal for making
consommé.
• Hundreds of classically codified garnishes for consommés exist, ranging from such
humble items as neatly diced root vegetables to the esoteric edible gold leaf. No matter
what the garnish may be, it is important that it be as well prepared as the consommé.
• Vegetable cuts for garnishes should be neat and precise. The seasoning selected for the
garnish should enhance the flavor of the consommé, not distract from it.

Quality Criteria of Consommé
A properly prepared consommé will:
• have a well-­balanced, rich flavor, and aroma reflecting the major ingredient.
• be perfectly clear and completely fat free.

In some cases, tomatoes may
be added at the beginning of the
cooking time, along with the aromatic

simmering time.

Hearty broths may also be made from a single vegetable (e.g., onion soup).
• Hearty broths include vegetables chosen both for their own flavors and for
their aromatic qualities. Prepare each vegetable by trimming, peeling, and
cutting it into neat and even-­size pieces so that they cook uniformly and have
an attractive appearance.
• Some hearty broths also include meat, poultry, or fish. Trim and cut meat,
poultry, or fish to suit the style of soup you are preparing. After cooking in the
soup, these ingredients are often diced or julienned and returned to the soup
just before it is finished. To intensify the flavor of a broth, the amount of meat
or vegetable may be increased. To further enhance the flavor and color of a
broth, brown the major flavoring ingredients (meat and/or vegetables) before
adding the liquid.
• Add peas, green beans, and leafy vegetables such as spinach or kale during
the final 15 to 20 minutes of simmering time for the soup. Some chefs prefer
to blanch these vegetables to help set the colors before adding them to a
soup.
• Less tender cuts of meat should be added to the soup early in the cooking
process so that they will flavor the broth properly and finish cooking at the
same time as the other ingredients. Add fish or shellfish to hearty broths
close to the end of cooking time to prevent overcooking.
• Other ingredients might include beans, whole grains, or pasta. For a
relatively clear soup, cook these starchy ingredients separately and add them
to the soup as a garnish. A more rustic approach calls for these ingredients to
be cooked in the broth as part of the soup-­making process. Such soups tend
to have more body and are sometimes referred to as hearty vegetable soups.
Beans may be par-­cooked or fully cooked before adding to soups since their
cooking time is much longer than most other vegetables of similar size.
• Clear broths, good-­quality stocks, water, or juices are all used as the liquid
base for vegetable soups. Be sure to taste the liquid and add seasonings
as necessary from the start of cooking time up to and including just before
service. Bring the liquid to a simmer over low heat while preparing the
other ingredients, along with seasonings and aromatics as needed. This will
improve the flavor of the finished broth and help reduce overall cooking time,
since the soup will come to the correct cooking speed more quickly.

294 | MISE EN PLACE, STOCKS, SAUCES, AND SOUPS

• Garnishes are as varied as the soups themselves. Croutons are common, and they may
be an integral part of the preparation, as in Onion Soup Gratinée (page 306). Add other
garnishes, such as pesto, grated cheese, or even beaten eggs, to soups just before service.
Purées of red peppers, chiles, tomato, or sorrel may also be added at the last moment for
a dash of color and flavor. Fortified wines (such as sherry), vinegar, or citrus juices may be
used for last-­minute flavor adjustments.
• Most soups cook from start to finish in a single pot. The pot should be taller than it is
wide to allow the soup to cook gently and evenly at a constant simmer. Skimmers, ladles,
and spoons are all used throughout the preparation time.

CREAM SOUPS
A cream soup is a velouté-­or béchamel-­based soup that is finished with heavy cream.
However, contemporary chefs no longer draw a distinction between the two; they frequently
substitute a velouté base for the béchamel in cream soups or even use the term cream to
refer to a purée soup that has simply been finished with cream.
• The main flavoring for some cream soups is often a single ingredient, such as broccoli,
asparagus, chicken, or fish.
• Vegetables, whether used as main flavoring ingredients or as aromatics, should be well
rinsed, then peeled, trimmed, and cut into small, uniform pieces so they cook evenly. When
simmering poultry or fish in the soup to give flavor and body, be sure to trim, truss, or cut
those ingredients as appropriate.
• A white mirepoix may be used in place of other aromatics to preserve the light color of the
soup, depending on what main ingredient is being used.
• Use a well-­seasoned, full-­bodied broth, stock, or light velouté. Milk or a light béchamel is
sometimes appropriate. Bring the liquid up to a simmer, along with seasonings, aromatics,
or other ingredients meant to provide flavor. Refer to specific recipes for guidance.
• Thickeners including prepared roux, flour or potatoes, or the natural thickening of the puréed
main ingredient give cream soups their texture. However, added thickeners are unnecessary if
the base liquid is a prepared velouté.
• For a healthier option: Use puréed vegetables or beans (especially those high in starch) to
thicken the soup in place of roux, velouté, or flour.
• Assemble finishing ingredients, final flavoring and seasonings, and garnishes ahead of
time to be ready to add at the proper time. Bring cream to a simmer before adding it to
simmering soup. Blend liaisons and temper them just before serving the soup.
• Pots with heavy flat bottoms, made of nonreactive materials such as stainless steel or
anodized aluminum, are a good choice for cream soups. Simmer cream soups on flattops
or a heat diffuser to prevent hot spots from developing and scorching the soup. Have
wooden spoons, ladles, and skimmers available throughout the cooking process.
• Use blenders (countertop or immersion) and food mills singly or in combination to purée
the soup. For a velvety texture in the finished soup, you may also need fine-­mesh strainers
or cheesecloth to strain the soup a final time.

• have a rich flavor, balancing the main flavoring ingredient(s) and supporting
aromatic and finishing flavors.
• have a velvety texture, and a lightly thickened consistency, similar to heavy
cream.

CHOWDER
Chowders get their name from the French word chaudière, a kettle in which
fishermen made their stews. Classically, chowders were made from seafood
and included pork, potatoes, and onions, though it is not uncommon for any
thick, rich, and chunky soup to be called a chowder. There is also a group of
chowders, of which Manhattan-­style clam chowder may be the most widely
known, that are prepared more like a hearty broth.
• The main flavoring ingredients for chowder are often shellfish, fish,
or vegetables, such as corn. Vegetables, whether used as main flavoring
ingredients or as aromatics, should be well rinsed, then peeled, trimmed, and
cut into small and uniform pieces so they cook evenly.
• Use a well-­seasoned, full-­bodied broth or stock, or water. Bring the liquid
up to a simmer, along with seasonings, aromatics, or other ingredients meant
to provide flavor. Refer to specific recipes for guidance. Thickeners, including
flour and potatoes, give chowders their texture.
• Assemble the finishing ingredients, final flavoring and seasonings, and
garnishes ahead of time to be ready to add at the proper time. If adding
cream, bring it to a simmer before adding it to the simmering chowder.
• The sanger method is typically used to make a chowder, in which the flour
for thickening is cooked with the aromatics, rather than separately as for
velouté. For this reason, more fat is necessary when cooking the aromatics;
this is critical to successfully making any soup using the singer method.
• If using a roux, the vegetables release moisture during the sweating period,
which can interfere with the formation of the roux. Using the proper amount
of roux made separately ensures the success of the chowder’s thickness and
consistency.

PURÉE SOUPS
Purée soups are soups that are slightly thicker than cream soups and have a
somewhat coarser texture, often based on dried legumes, potatoes, or starchy
vegetables. Purée soups are usually entirely puréed, though occasionally some
of the solids are left whole for textural interest.
• Many purée soups are based on dried beans: Great Northern, navy, or
black beans, lentils, and split peas, for example. Beans other than lentils and
split peas may be soaked for several hours before cooking. The beans absorb

302 | MISE EN PLACE, STOCKS, SAUCES, AND SOUPS

some liquid, the overall cooking time is shortened, and the beans cook more evenly and
absorb less liquid during the cooking process.
• Relatively starchy vegetables such as potatoes, squash, or celery root are often the base
for other purée soups. These have to be peeled and diced or sliced. Even though these
ingredients are puréed, relative uniformity of cut size is necessary for the ingredients to
cook evenly.
• Aromatic ingredients such as onions, garlic, carrots, and celery are often found in purée
soups. Vegetables may be roasted or grilled beforehand for extra flavor. Consult specific
recipes for preparation and cutting instructions.
• Water, broth, and stock are the most frequently used base liquids. Check the freshness of
broths or stocks that have been stored before using them in a soup.
• Many purée soups call for a bit of rendered salt pork,
smoked ham, bacon, or other cured pork products. In
some instances, these ingredients should be blanched
first to remove any excess salt: cover them with cool
water, bring the water to a simmer, and then drain and
rinse. Consult specific recipes for more guidance.
• An alternative is to use a ham-­based broth. Besides
cured pork, ingredients used to season purée soups
are as diverse as chiles, dried mushrooms, hot sauce,
citrus zest or juice, and vinegar. Garnishes include
chopped herbs, croutons, diced meats, toasted or fried
tortillas, salsas, and dollops of sour cream.
• Although not necessary, finishing ingredients may
include milk or cream. Purée soups are often garnished
with croutons or small dice of a complementary meat,
fresh herbs, or a vegetable.
• For a healthier option, reduce or remove additions
that will add excess fat and calories, such as meat
products. Use vegetables as the primary or sole
garnish.
• Equipment requirements for making purée soups are
quite similar to those for cream soups. Look for pots
with heavy bottoms to avoid scorching and developing
hot spots. If available, a heat diffuser or other similar
device should be used to keep the heat even.
• Puréeing equipment such as a food mill or blender is
necessary to finish the soup.

Food mills can be used to purée soups.

Quality Criteria of Purée Soups
A properly prepared purée soup will:
• still be liquid enough to pour easily from a ladle into a bowl, with a consistency similar to
heavy cream.
• have a proper balance between solid ingredients and liquid, resulting in a soup with a
pleasing, robust flavor.

BISQUES
Bisques are soups based on crustaceans, such as shrimp, lobster, or crayfish, and thickened
with rice, rice flour, or bread. The shells are usually pulverized along with the other
ingredients before a final straining. The end result is a soup with a consistency like that of a
cream soup.
• Traditional bisques get their
color and flavor from shrimp,
lobster, crab, or crayfish shells.
Use one type of crustacean or a
combination.
• Contemporary bisques may be
based on ingredients other than
crustaceans and may rely on a
vegetable purée or roux as the
thickener. Added thickeners are
unnecessary if using a prepared
velouté.
• A good-­quality stock or broth is as
important to the flavor of a bisque
as the shells are. If available, a
prepared light velouté made from
a shellfish or fish stock, thickened
with a blond roux, may be used.

306 | MISE EN PLACE, STOCKS, SAUCES, AND SOUPS

• A vegetable-­based bisque is prepared in the same manner as
a purée soup. If the main vegetable does not contain enough
starch to act as a thickener, rice, roux, or a starchy vegetable
such as potato may be used to provide additional thickness.
When the vegetables are tender, the soup is puréed until
smooth. Consequently, the distinction between a purée and a
bisque is not always clear.
• A rice-thickened stock may also be used as the base for the
soup. In that case, there is no need to add either flour or a
prepared roux.
• Crustacean meat and shells for bisque should be rinsed well,
then coarsely chopped. Shellfish should be scrubbed clean.
Check the quality of stored fumets, stocks, or broths used to
prepare a bisque before use. Bring a small amount to a boil
and taste it for any sour or off odors. Peel, trim, and chop any
vegetables to be used in the bisque. Chopped onion, mirepoix,
or garlic is generally a part of the soup. Other ingredients
frequently used to add flavor and color include tomato paste,
sweet paprika, brandy, and wine.
• Cream and sherry are finishing ingredients for most bisques.
Diced cooked pieces of the main flavoring ingredient commonly garnish a
bisque.
• Use puréed vegetables (especially those high in starch) to thicken the soup
in place of roux, velouté, or flour. Replace cream with evaporated skim milk to
reduce calories and fat.
• The equipment requirements for making bisque are identical to those for
making cream soup and include a heavy-­gauge pot, puréeing equipment,
and a strainer or cheesecloth, as well as equipment for holding, serving, and
storing.

Method in Detail
1

Rinse the shells well and chop larger shells, such as crab or lobster. Drain
and dry them well. Brown the shells in the cooking fat, stirring frequently,
until they turn a bright pink or red and remove them from the pan.

2

Add the mirepoix to the pan and cook it over medium heat for 20 to
30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the onions are light
brown. Tomato paste is often added at this point and allowed to cook until
it has a sweet aroma and a deep rust color. Add spices such as paprika to
the shells and other aromatics to cook in the fat.

A properly prepared bisque will:
• reflect the flavor of the main ingredient.
• be the consistency of heavy cream, though all bisques are slightly coarse or grainy.
• be appropriately colored depending on the main ingredient. A crustacean bisque ranges
from pale pink or red to ivory in color and a vegetable bisque, a paler shade of the main
vegetable.

1

Blend the mirepoix, ground chicken, egg whites, salt, tomatoes, the sachet ingredients, clove, and allspice. Allow to
macerate for 1 to 2 hours if time permits.

2

Heat the stock to approximately 100°F/38°C in a stockpot sized to accommodate all the ingredients. Add the
clarification mixture to the stock. Stir to combine thoroughly.

3

Bring the mixture to 145°F/63°C, stirring frequently until the raft just begins to form, 8 to 10 minutes. Look for the
proteins to start to float and form small quarter-­size clumps with lighter, unclarified broth between them. Once raft
forms, firmly create a small hole in part of the raft. If using, add the oignons brûlés to the stock near the hole.

4

Simmer slowly at approximately 180°F/82°C until the appropriate flavor and clarity is achieved, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Baste
the raft occasionally through the opening. Always taste to make sure the consommé has developed full flavor before
straining.

5

Strain the consommé through a damp paper filter or rinsed doubled cheesecloth: Use a ladle to push down on the
raft carefully at the hole and allow the broth to flow into the ladle before pouring through the filter. Repeat until the
raft hits the bottom of the pot. Carefully tilt the broth into the ladle and do not break the raft. Adjust seasoning with
salt as needed. The consommé is now ready to finish, or may be rapidly cooled and refrigerated for later service.

6

To finish the soup for service, return it to a boil. Degrease the hot consommé by skimming or blotting with paper
towels, or lift the fat from the surface of the refrigerated consommé.

7

Taste the consommé and adjust seasoning with salt. Serve in heated bowls or cups and garnish as desired.

NOTE: If the first clarification was less than successful, clarify a second time by combining 1 gal/3.84 L cold consommé with no more than 12 beaten
egg whites, a small amount of mirepoix, and 1 tbsp/15 mL chopped tomatoes. Bring the consommé slowly to a boil. As the egg whites coagulate, the
impurities will be trapped. This emergency measure, however, tends to remove not only the impurities but some flavor as well.

In a large sauce pot or rondeau, caramelize the onions in the butter over medium-­high heat, stirring occasionally,
until browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Do not add any salt at this time, to prevent the extraction of moisture and allow for
optimum caramelization.

Deglaze the pan with the Calvados and reduce over medium-­high to high heat until it reaches a syrupy consistency.

3

Add the stock and the sachet and simmer until the onions are tender and the soup is properly flavored, 30 to
35 minutes. The soup is ready to finish now, or may be rapidly cooled and refrigerated for later service.

To finish the soup for service, return it to a boil. Season with salt and pepper and serve in heated bowls or cups.

NOTE: If sherry is used, add it to the soup at the end of cooking time. Adding sherry at step 2 can cause the wine flavor to dissipate. Sweet wines like
sherry are best added when soup is finished.

CHAPTER 14

SAUCES
Sauces are often considered one of
the greatest tests of a chef’s skill.
The successful pairing of a sauce
with a food demonstrates technical
expertise, an understanding of the
food, and the ability to judge and
evaluate a dish’s flavors, textures,
and colors.

A good sauce can contrast or complement final flavors in a dish to enhance the taste. For
example, a rich pork dish that has lots of fat benefits from the sharpness of an acidic sauce.
Sauces add moisture to dishes featuring lean foods, such as poultry or fish, or replenish the
moisture lost through dry-­cooking techniques, such as grilling and roasting. They can also
help balance texture in a dish and improve its appearance.
In this chapter, you’ll learn about the grand sauces and some of their derivatives, plus other
everyday sauces and dressings used in the savory kitchen.
Most sauces have more than one function in a dish. A sauce that adds a counterpoint flavor,
for example, may also introduce textural and visual appeal. Sauces generally serve one or
more of the following purposes.
• Introduce complementary or counterpoint flavors
• Add moisture or succulence
• Add visual interest
• Adjust texture

GRAND SAUCES
The grand sauces, also known as mother sauces, are velouté, béchamel, espagnole, tomato,
and hollandaise. First identified by Auguste Escoffier in the nineteenth century, these
sauces are the foundation of French sauce making and the base for many of the sauces still
used today.
• Brown sauces like espagnole or demi-­glace are made using brown or fortified stock.
The mother sauce, espagnole, is the primary brown sauce, and it’s used to create many
variations, such as demi-­glace or glace, which is further reduced demi-­glace. Brown sauces
get their depth of flavor and umami from caramelized mirepoix and the Maillard reaction,
which gives them smoky, meaty undertones that work best with roasted meat.
• White sauces like velouté and béchamel are made by thickening a liquid with a roux.
The liquid could be milk for béchamel, or a light stock made from veal, chicken, fish, or
vegetables for velouté. White sauces are the most common thickeners for soups and other
sauces, and they’re also used as binders in things like croquettes, stuffings, or baked pasta
dishes.
• Tomato sauce is made from fresh or canned tomatoes. Tomato sauce provides the base
for almost endless seasoning possibilities, and it’s often served with fish, pasta, grilled
vegetables, and poultry.
• Hollandaise is prepared by combining a vinegar reduction or lemon juice, egg yolks, and
melted or clarified butter. Making a successful hollandaise is a common test of a chef’s skill
and is not usually accomplished without practice.
By adding certain ingredients to grand sauces, they become unique secondary and tertiary
sauces that build on the original flavor profile. These are called grand sauce derivatives.

BROWN SAUCE
At one time, the term brown sauce was equated exclusively with the classic sauces espagnole
and demi-­glace. Today, it may also indicate jus de veau lié, pan sauces, or reduction-­style
sauces based on a brown or fortified stock.
• Brown Veal Stock (page 281) is typically used as the base stock for a brown sauce. The
stock must be of excellent quality, with a rich and well-­balanced flavor and aroma, and
without any strong notes of mirepoix, herbs, or spices that might overwhelm the finished
sauce.
• Bones and trim, cut in small pieces for faster extraction, are added to the base stock to
improve its flavor. Mirepoix, cut into large dice, may also be added. However, if the stock is
extremely flavorful, additional bones, trim, and mirepoix may not be necessary. Mushroom
trim, herbs, garlic, or shallots may also be added to the sauce as it develops.
• Roux (see page 253) is one thickening option. It may be prepared ahead of time or may
be prepared as part of the sauce-­making process. The thickener of choice for jus lié is
cornstarch, although another pure starch, such as potato starch or arrowroot, may be
used. Cornstarch is preferable because it results in a translucent, glossy sauce.
• To improve the flavor, additional ingredients such as the following may be added as the
sauce develops: bones and trim; mirepoix, cut into small pieces; mushroom trim, cut into
large dice; herbs; garlic; shallots.
• Some ingredients may be added to the simmering sauce after it has finished cooking,
like wine that has been reduced from deglazing, fortified wines such as Port, Madeira, or
sherry, or whole butter.
• Brown sauces sometimes develop a skin when they are held uncovered. To avoid this, use
a fitted cover for the bain-­marie or a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap cut to fit
directly on the surface of the sauce.

Quality Criteria of Brown Sauce
A properly prepared brown sauce will:
• have a full, rich flavor of roasted meat or vegetables with a pleasant roasted or caramel
aroma.
• have no bitter or burnt flavors.
• be deep brown in color without any dark specks or debris.

332 | MISE EN PLACE, STOCKS, SAUCES, AND SOUPS

Derivatives
• Espagnole sauce is prepared by bolstering a brown veal stock with additional roasted
mirepoix, tomato pinçage, and aromatics and thickening it with brown roux.
• Classically, demi-­glace is composed of equal parts espagnole and brown stock and
reduced by half or to a nappé consistency. These days, it may be made of brown stock with
additional browned trim and mirepoix, and reduced to a nappé consistency and optionally
thickened with a starch slurry. Jus liés are made by reducing brown stocks or fortified
stocks (with added flavorings, if desired) and thickening them with a pure starch slurry.
• Pan sauces and reduction sauces are produced as part of the roasting or sautéing
cooking process; thickening can be accomplished by reduction or the addition of roux or
pure starch slurries. Regardless of the approach taken, the end goal is the same: to make
a basic brown sauce that is flavorful enough to be served as is but can also be used as the
foundation for other sauces.
• Jus lié is generally prepared in a saucepan or pot that is wider than it is tall. This is
the most effective means of extracting flavors fully and quickly into the finished sauce.
You will also need a kitchen spoon, ladle, or skimmer to skim the developing sauce, and
tasting spoons, fine-­mesh strainers, and containers to hold the finished sauce. Additional
containers are necessary for both cooling and storing the sauce.

WHITE SAUCE
The white sauce family includes the classic sauces velouté and béchamel, both produced by
thickening a liquid with roux.
A classic velouté, which translates from French as “velvety, soft, and smooth to the palate,”
is prepared by flavoring a white stock (veal, chicken, or fish) with aromatics and thickening it
with blond roux.
In Escoffier’s time, a béchamel sauce was made by adding cream to a relatively thick velouté
sauce. Today, it is made by thickening milk (sometimes infused with aromatics for flavor) with
a pale roux.
• Stock (veal, chicken, fish, or vegetable) or milk used to make white sauces may be
brought to a simmer and, if desired, infused with aromatics and flavorings to produce a
special flavor and/or color in the finished sauce.
• Blond roux is the traditional thickener for veloutés; blond or white roux may be used for
a béchamel (the darker the roux, the more golden the sauce will be). The amount of roux
determines the thickness of a white sauce (see more about roux, page 253).
• Additional mirepoix, mushroom trim, or members of the onion family are sometimes
added, either to strengthen the flavor of the sauce or to create a specific flavor profile. Cut
them into small dice or slice them thinly to encourage rapid flavor release into the sauce.
• White sauces scorch easily, and they can take on a grayish cast if prepared in an
aluminum pan. Choose a heavy nonaluminum pot with a perfectly flat bottom for the best
results. Simmer white sauces on a flattop for gentle, even heat, or use a heat diffuser if
available.
• The liquid used to make a white sauce is different depending on the desired use and
whether it is a velouté or a béchamel. Liquids used to make velouté include white veal
stock, chicken stock, fish stock, or vegetable stock. The liquid used to make béchamel is
typically milk.
• Additional seasonings may be added depending on the desired flavor profile and the
richness of the stock. Mirepoix and vegetable trim from mushrooms or onions would be
added at the beginning of the cooking process, while aromatics such as a sachet should be
added during the last 30 minutes of simmering. When adding cheese, it should be grated
and stirred in after the sauce has been thickened, and simmered before straining.
• White sauces may develop a skin if held uncovered. To avoid this, use a fitted cover on the
bain-­marie or place a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap directly on the surface of
the sauce.

TOMATO SAUCE
Tomato sauce is a generic term used to describe any sauce based mainly on tomatoes. Tomato
sauces can be made several ways. They may be raw or cooked, anywhere from 10 minutes to
several hours. In some versions, olive oil is the only cooking fat. For others, rendered salt pork
or bacon is required. Some recipes call for roasted veal or pork bones; others are made strictly
from tomatoes and other vegetables. Some tomato sauces are puréed until smooth while
others are left chunky. Escoffier’s tomato sauce relied on roux as a thickener.

338 | MISE EN PLACE, STOCKS, SAUCES, AND SOUPS

Plum tomatoes

• Good tomato sauce can be made from fresh or canned tomatoes. When fresh tomatoes
are at their peak, it may be a good idea to use them exclusively. At other times of the year,
good-­quality canned tomatoes are a better choice.
• Plum tomatoes, sometimes referred to as Romas, are generally preferred for tomato
sauces because they have a high ratio of flesh to skin and seeds. Fresh tomatoes may
be skinned and seeded for sauce, or they may be simply rinsed, cored, and quartered or
chopped. Canned tomatoes come peeled and whole, crushed or puréed, or a combination
of the two. Tomato paste is sometimes added to the sauce as well.
• There are many choices for additional flavoring ingredients. Some recipes call for a
standard mirepoix as the aromatic vegetable component, while others rely on garlic and
onions. Fresh and/or dried herbs, smoked meats, meat bones, or stock are common
additions.
• Onions and other aromatics added at the very beginning of the cooking process may be
sautéed until lightly browned rather than until just tender for additional depth of flavor.
• When appropriate, a tomato sauce may be thickened with roux or pure starch slurries.
• Choose a heavy-­gauge pot made of nonreactive materials such as stainless steel or
anodized aluminum because tomatoes have a high acid content. Because of the high sugar
content of some tomatoes, you will need to establish an even heat without hot spots so the
sauce will not scorch.
• Use a food mill to purée the sauce. For a very smooth texture, you may wish to use a
blender, immersion blender, or food processor.

less cooking time, the better for any sauce based on fruits or vegetables.
Extended cooking diminishes the fresh flavors. Most tomato sauces should
be cooked just long enough for the flavors to meld together. If a tomato
sauce that is not going to be puréed is too watery, strain it and reduce the
excess liquid separately to avoid overcooking.
Purée the sauce, if desired, using a food mill. If using a blender, a small
amount of oil added during puréeing will emulsify the sauce, creating
a lighter yet thicker consistency. Puréeing the sauce with a blender will
lighten the color of the sauce, changing it from red to orange, which may
not be desirable.
Check the balance and seasoning of the sauce and make any
necessary adjustments to its flavor and consistency by adding salt,
pepper, fresh herbs, or other ingredients as indicated in the recipe. At this
point, the sauce is ready to be served. It may be finished for service as
desired, or it may be cooled and stored.

Quality Criteria of Tomato Sauce
A properly prepared tomato sauce will:
• be opaque and slightly coarse, with a concentrated flavor of tomatoes and no trace of
bitterness or excess acidity or sweetness. The ingredients selected to flavor the sauce
should provide only subtle underpinnings.
• have a texture appropriate for use.

HOLLANDAISE SAUCE
Hollandaise sauce is prepared by emulsifying melted or clarified butter and water (in the
form of an acidic reduction and/or lemon juice) with partially cooked egg yolks.
Since the largest part of hollandaise is butter, the success or failure of the sauce depends not
only on skillfully combining egg yolks, water, acid, and butter into a rich, smooth sauce, but
also on the quality of the butter itself.
• Melted whole butter or clarified butter may be used in a hollandaise. Melted whole butter
provides a richer, creamier texture, while clarified butter provides a stiffer, more stable
sauce. Whatever the approach, the butter must be quite warm (about 145°F/63°C) but not
too hot for the sauce to come together successfully.
• If using clarified butter to make the hollandaise, save the milk solids and use them to
adjust the consistency of the finished sauce and add flavor.
• In general, the ratio of egg to butter is 1 egg yolk to every 2 to 3 oz/57 to 85 g butter.
As the volume of sauce increases, the amount of butter that can be emulsified with 1 egg
yolk also increases. A hollandaise made with 20 yolks, for instance, can usually tolerate
more than 3 oz/85 g butter per yolk. Pasteurized egg yolks may be used for hollandaise,
if desired. However, the method outlined here cooks the yolks enough that Salmonella
bacteria, a major concern with eggs, are rendered harmless.

342 | MISE EN PLACE, STOCKS, SAUCES, AND SOUPS

• An acidic ingredient is included in hollandaise both for flavor and for the effect it has on
the protein in the egg yolks. The acidic ingredient, which can be either a vinegar reduction
and/or lemon juice, also provides the water necessary to form an emulsion. Whether to
use a reduction or lemon juice is determined by the desired flavor of the finished sauce. A
reduction will impart a more complex flavor, particularly if lemon juice is also used as a final
seasoning.
• One of the keys to successfully making hollandaise sauce is having all of the mise en place
prepared. This fragile sauce, unlike many other sauces, is prepared in a single operation.
• Holding hollandaise presents an unusual challenge. The sauce must be held below
150°F/66°C to keep the yolks from curdling, but at this temperature the sauce hovers just
above the danger zone for bacterial growth. The acid from the reduction and/or lemon
juice help keep some bacteria at bay, but the sauce should never be held longer than
2 hours.

Quality Criteria for Hollandaise Sauce
A properly prepared Hollandaise will:
• have a balanced taste, with butter serving as the predominant flavor.
• be a lemon-­yellow color.
• have a satiny-­smooth texture that is not oily. The consistency should be light and pourable.

Fixing a Hollandaise
If the hollandaise sauce does start to break, try adding a small amount of water and whisking
until the sauce is smooth before adding more butter. If that doesn’t work, combine another
egg yolk with 1 tsp/5 mL water, and cook over simmering water until thickened, and then
gradually whisk the broken hollandaise into the new egg yolk. Note, however, that a sauce
restored in this manner will not have the same volume as a sauce that did not have to be
rescued, and it will not hold as well.

When a hollandaise breaks, the butter will separate from the sauce,
leaving a greasy layer on the top and sides of the bowl

346 | MISE EN PLACE, STOCKS, SAUCES, AND SOUPS

Derivative Sauces
Specific ingredients may be added to produce a derivative hollandaise sauce after it is
made. Add glace de viande, tomato purée, essences or juices, or other semi-­liquid or
liquid ingredients to the sauce gradually to avoid thinning it too much. Including flavoring
ingredients may mean that other seasonings and flavorings need to be adjusted again.
A number of similar warm butter emulsion sauces, as this group of sauces is sometimes
known, can be prepared by varying the ingredients in the reduction or by adding different
finishing and garnishing ingredients such as tarragon. The group includes béarnaise, choron,
and mousseline sauces. Hollandaise can also be combined with whipped cream and/or
velouté to prepare a glaçage, and used to coat a dish that is then lightly browned under a
salamander or broiler just before service.
Some hollandaise-­style sauces are finished with minced herbs. Herbs should be properly
rinsed, dried, and cut into uniform mince or chiffonade with a very sharp knife to retain color
and flavor. Finely diced tomato or citrus suprêmes may also be added to certain hollandaise-­
style sauces; these garnishes should be properly cut and allowed to drain so that excess
moisture does not thin the sauce.

BEURRE BLANC
Beurre blanc is a sauce made by blending cold butter into a warm acidic reduction, forming
an emulsion.
• The quality of the butter is critical to the success of a beurre blanc. Unsalted butter is
best because the salt level can better be controlled later on. Check the butter carefully for
a creamy texture and sweet aroma. Cube the butter and keep it cool.
• A standard reduction for a beurre blanc is made from dry white wine and shallots. (When
prepared as part of a shallow-­poached dish, the cooking liquid becomes the reduction
used in the sauce.) Other ingredients often used in the reduction include vinegar or citrus
juice; chopped herbs including tarragon, basil, chives, or chervil; cracked peppercorns; and
sometimes garlic, ginger, lemongrass, saffron, and other flavoring ingredients.
• A small amount of reduced heavy cream is occasionally added to stabilize the emulsion.
To use cream, reduce it by half separately. Carefully simmer the cream until it thickens
and has a rich, ivory-­yellow color. The more reduced the cream, the greater its stabilizing
effect. The more stable the sauce, the longer it will last during service. However, the flavor
of cream will overpower the fresh taste of the butter.

348 | MISE EN PLACE, STOCKS, SAUCES, AND SOUPS

• Select a pan made from a nonreactive material. Bi-­metal pans, such as copper or
anodized aluminum lined with stainless steel, are excellent choices for this sauce.
• A whisk may be used to incorporate the butter into the sauce, but many chefs prefer to
allow the motion of the pan swirling over the burner or flattop to incorporate the butter.
Straining is optional for this sauce, but if you choose to strain either the reduction or the
finished sauce, you will need a sieve.
• The prepared sauce may be kept warm in the container used to prepare it, or it may be
transferred to a clean bain-­marie insert, ceramic vessel, or wide-­necked vacuum bottle.
• To prepare a large batch of beurre blanc and hold it through a service period, hold the
sauce at or near 145°F/63°C for no more than 2 hours. The sauce may deteriorate over
time, however, and must be monitored for quality.

chapter 14 • SAUCES | 351

VINAIGRETTES
A vinaigrette is a temporary emulsion made by blending oil, acid, and other ingredients until
they form a homogeneous sauce. The sauce remains an emulsion for a only a short time,
quickly separating back into oil and vinegar. Both oils and vinegars can be flavored. To add
flavor and help stabilize the sauce, an emulsifier is sometimes included.
Vinaigrettes are thought of mainly as dressings for green salads, but they are used in many
other ways as well: as marinades for grilled or broiled foods; to dress salads made from
pastas, grains, vegetables, and beans; as dips; as sauces served with hot or cold entrées and
appetizers; brushed on sandwiches.
• A standard vinaigrette ratio of three parts oil to one part acid works well as a starting
point, but the vinaigrette needs to be tasted and evaluated whenever a change is made in
the type of oil, acid, or specific flavoring ingredients.
• Select the oil with an eye to both its flavor and cost.
Oils used in salad dressings can be subtle or intensely
flavored. Oils may serve simply to carry the other
flavors in the vinaigrette, or they may have readily
identifiable flavors of their own. Very strongly flavored
oils are often blended with less intense oils to produce
a balanced flavor in the finished sauce.
• Good-­quality oils and vinegars can be infused with
spices, aromatics, herbs, and fruits or vegetables (see
page 262 for more information). They can be used in
vinaigrettes and other dressings for a special effect.
• The choice of acid ranges widely as well, from vinegar,
to fruit juice, to malted barley, to similar acidic liquids.
Every vinegar has a different level of tartness or acidity.
• Additional vinaigrette ingredients include
emulsifiers (egg yolks, mustard, roasted garlic, fruit
or vegetable purées, or glace de viande) and such
seasonings as salt, pepper, herbs, and spices. The
challenge of making a good vinaigrette lies in achieving
balance, a point at which the acidity of the vinegar or juice
is tempered but not dominated by the richness of the oil.
• Equipment needs for making vinaigrettes are minimal:
measuring spoons or cups, a bowl, and a whisk or a
blender, immersion blender, food processor, or electric
mixer.
• Vinaigrettes will begin to separate over time,

Quality Criteria of Vinaigrettes
A properly prepared vinaigrette will:
• have a well-­balanced flavor that is not too sour.
• be a consistency that clings to greens and other ingredients without being too oily.

MAYONNAISE
Mayonnaise is a cold sauce made by combining egg yolks with oil to form a stable emulsion.
Because of its great versatility, it is often included in the list of the basic or “grand” sauces
prepared in the professional kitchen.
Unlike vinaigrette, this sauce does not break as it sits. Mayonnaise and sauces made with
mayonnaise as a base can be used to dress salads or as a dip or spread.
• Classic recipes for mayonnaise call for 6 to 8 fl oz/180 to 240 mL of oil to each egg
yolk. Egg yolks provide both the liquid, which holds the oil droplets in suspension, and an
emulsifier known as lecithin. To avoid any possible food-­borne illnesses (such as those
caused by Salmonella or E. coli), professional chefs should use pasteurized egg yolks.
• Since mayonnaise is often intended as a base sauce to be used for a variety of purposes,
it is usually best to choose an oil that does not have a pronounced flavor of its own. There
are exceptions to this general rule, however. For example, a mayonnaise made with extra-­
virgin olive oil or a nut oil would be appropriate to serve as a dip with a platter of grilled
vegetables or crudités.
• A small amount of mustard is often called for in mayonnaise. Though prepared mustard
is used as an emulsifier in some cold sauces and vinaigrettes, its primary function in a
mayonnaise is flavor. Various acids may also be used to prepare a mayonnaise, including
lemon juice or wine or cider vinegars. The acid, along with water, flavors the sauce as well
as provides additional moisture for the emulsification. Using distilled white vinegar also
helps to keep the mayonnaise white. Additional flavoring ingredients, such as garlic or
herbs, may also be needed as indicated by specific recipe and/or desired use.

354 | MISE EN PLACE, STOCKS, SAUCES, AND SOUPS

• By adding flavoring or garnish ingredients, a basic mayonnaise can be used to produce a
different sauce. Aïoli, a garlic-­flavored mayonnaise, calls for a good quantity of garlic to be
included in the earliest stages of mixing. However, other ingredients may be blended into
the sauce once the oil is incorporated to create sauces such as rémoulade sauce or green
goddess dressing.
• Equipment needs for making mayonnaise are minimal: measuring spoons or cups, a
bowl, and a whisk are appropriate for small quantities. For large batches, use a blender,
food processor, or electric mixer. Mayonnaise sauces should be held in very clean storage
containers.
• Keep mayonnaise refrigerated at all times once it is prepared. Transfer it to a storage
container, cover it carefully, and label it with a date. Before using mayonnaise that has been
stored, stir it gently and check the seasoning carefully.

Adjust the thickness and flavor of the sauce by adding a bit more acid or

the thicker the sauce will become. Add more lemon juice, vinegar, or a little
water when the mayonnaise becomes very thick. If this step is neglected,
the sauce will become too thick to absorb any more oil and can separate.
Add any additional flavoring or garnish ingredients at the point indicated in
the recipe.

Quality Criteria of Mayonnaise
A properly prepared mayonnaise will:
• have a mild and balanced flavor, without any predominance of acidic or oily flavors.
• be thick, creamy, and completely homogeneous in texture and appearance.
• be white or slightly off-­white in color, not greenish or yellow.

FIXING A BROKEN MAYONNAISE
Mayonnaise and similarly prepared dressings may break for a
number of reasons:
• The oil was added too rapidly for the egg yolk to absorb it.
• The sauce was allowed to become too thick.
• The sauce became either too cold or too warm as it was
being prepared.
A broken mayonnaise can be saved by combining 2 tbsp/30 mL of
pasteurized egg yolk with 1 tsp/5 mL water and beating the mixture
until foamy. Gradually add the broken mayonnaise into the diluted
yolk, whisking constantly, until the mayonnaise regains a smooth,
creamy appearance.

PAN SAUCES
Jus and pan gravy are the most frequently prepared pan sauces, made using the drippings
found in the pan after sautéing and roasting, primarily. Onions, carrots, celery, garlic, or other
aromatic vegetables or herbs added to the pan during roasting will have browned and roasted
in the drippings. They will have a deep color and will have absorbed some of the flavor from
the drippings, so that they can properly flavor and color the finished pan sauce.
Before preparing any pan sauce, be sure that the drippings are not scorched. Scorched
drippings result in a bitter, unpalatable sauce.
To make a pan gravy after roasting, place the roasting pan on the stovetop and cook the
drippings over medium heat until the mirepoix is browned and the fat is transparent and
clear. The juices will have separated from the fat and cooked down to a fond on the bottom of
the pan. For a pan gravy, pour off the fat, but leave enough to prepare a roux by cooking the
fat and some flour together. If preparing a jus, flour is not used.
After the roux browns, gradually add the stock to the pan and stir constantly to work out
any lumps. Be sure the liquid is not too hot or it may spatter. Add the stock and simmer the
pan gravy or jus. Cook a pan gravy until thickened and the flavor has developed, but for a
minimum of 20 minutes to ensure the starch in the flour is sufficiently cooked. To prepare
a jus, pour off all of the remaining fat and deglaze the pan, if desired, with wine or another
liquid. Add a stock that suits the roasted food. Simmer until the flavor is well developed,
15 to 20 minutes. Skim the jus as it simmers to remove fat and particles from the surface.
A jus may be cooked down until thickened, or to prepare a jus lié, thicken the jus with an
arrowroot or cornstarch slurry just before straining.

The drippings should be golden brown, but if they are too dark, like
this pan, they will make a sauce bitter and unpleasant and should
be discarded.

Making a pan sauce from a sauté
chapter 14 • SAUCES | 359

For a pan sauce after sautéing, add aromatics to the pan, like mirepoix, and sauté until
browned and caramelized. Deglaze the pan using a liquid like stock, wine, juice, or even water,
and add any other flavoring ingredients, like fresh herbs. Scrape the bottom of the pan to
release any brown bits.
Simmer until the sauce is flavorful. If it needs additional thickening, add a prepared roux or
thicken with a pure starch slurry. Strain and hold for service.

REDUCTION SAUCES
Reduction sauces have a coating consistency. Reduction sauces are prepared by simmering
juices, wines, or other alcoholic beverages over low to moderate heat to thicken and develop
their individual characteristic flavors. Reducing liquids to create this type of sauce not only
serves to enhance the desired flavor of the ingredient, but may also concentrate undesirable
characteristics. For this reason, be careful when selecting ingredients for a reduction sauce,
as some do not reduce successfully.

1

Combine juices or wines and other alcoholic beverages and simmer over low to
moderate heat. The reduction will create the desired consistency, so monitor the sauce
as it is cooking for consistency at the required service temperature.

2

Once the sauce has reduced and thickened, strain through a fine-­mesh sieve.

3

Serve warm or cold.

GASTRIQUES
A gastrique is a sweet and sour mixture that can add depth and complexity to a finished dish,
or as an addition to another sauce.
Gastriques are typically made from equal parts sugar and acid and reduced by half over heat
for use in sauces, soups, and stews. They can be added either at the beginning of cooking
or the end. If the gastrique is added at the beginning of cooking, when making a reduction
sauce, the appropriate sugar for the dish is added after the aromatics are cooked, and may
even be caramelized, if appropriate, before the acid is added and reduced until dry. This is
usually followed by the wine (if used), which is also fully reduced, then the stock or demi-­
glaze, and reduced to taste.
If the gastrique is added at the end of cooking, as in a stew, it is made separately and added
by the tablespoon until a balance is perceived on the palate. A classic example of a gastrique
is the caramelization of sugar, which is deglazed with orange juice and then reduced before
adding duck demi-­glaze in Canard à l’orange. Examples of sugars used in gastriques are
granulated sugar, raw sugar, honey, or red currant jelly. Examples of acids include vinegars,
verjus, or acidic fruit juice.

SAUCE PAIRING
Certain classic sauce combinations endure because the composition is well balanced in all
areas: taste, texture, and eye appeal. When choosing an appropriate sauce, it should be:
• suitable for the style of service. In a banquet setting or in any situation where large
quantities of food must be served rapidly and at the peak of flavor, choose a sauce that
may be prepared in advance and held in large quantities at the correct temperature
without affecting quality. In an à la carte kitchen, sauces prepared à la minute are more
appropriate.
• matched to the main ingredient’s cooking technique. Pair a cooking technique that
produces flavorful drippings (fond), such as roasting or sautéing, with a sauce that makes
use of those drippings. Similarly, beurre blanc is suitable for foods that have been shallow-­
poached because the cooking liquid (cuisson) can become a part of the sauce.
• appropriate for the flavor of the food with which it is paired. Dover sole is perfectly
complemented by a delicate cream sauce. The same sauce would be overwhelmed by the
flavor of grilled tuna. Lamb has its own strong flavor that can stand up to a sauce flavored
with rosemary. The same sauce would completely overpower a delicate fish.

GUIDELINES FOR PLATING SAUCES
Maintain correct temperature. Check the temperature of the sauce, of the food being sauced,
and of the plate. Be sure that hot sauces are extremely hot, warm emulsion sauces are as
warm as possible without danger of breaking, and cold sauces remain cold until they come in
contact with hot foods.
Consider the texture of the food being served. Pool the sauce beneath the food, spreading it
in a layer directly on the plate if the food has a crisp or otherwise interesting texture. Spoon
or ladle the sauce evenly over the top of the food if it could benefit from a little cover or if the
sauce has visual appeal.
Serve an appropriate portion of sauce. There should be enough sauce for every bite of the
sauced food but not so much that the dish looks swamped. Too much sauce disturbs the
balance between the items on the plate and makes it difficult for the waiter to carry the food
from the kitchen to the guest’s table without at least some of the sauce running onto the rim,
or worse, over the edge of the plate.

ESSENTIAL
COOKING
TECHNIQUES

CHAPTER 15

GRILLING AND
BROILING
Grilling and broiling are quick
cooking techniques used for
naturally tender pieces of meat,
poultry, fish, and vegetables.

Grilling cooks food with radiant heat from a source located below it. Some of the juices are
reduced directly on the food while the rest drip away. Grilled foods have a slightly smoky
flavor, resulting from the juices and fats that are rendered and lightly charred as the food
cooks, as well as from direct contact with the rods of the grill rack.
Broiling is similar to grilling but uses a heat source located above the food rather than below
it. The sauce that accompanies a grilled or broiled item is prepared separately.
• Tender cuts of poultry; cuts of meat from the loin, rib, or top round; and fillets of such fatty
fish as tuna, swordfish, and salmon are suited to grilling and broiling. Lean fish or whole
small fish such as Dover sole or small flounders may also be grilled or broiled if they are
coated with oil or an oil-­based marinade and cooked in a hinged hand grill to prevent them
from breaking apart during the cooking process.

Hinged hand grill for grilling whole fish

• Delicate foods like lean white fish are brushed with butter or oil, put on a heated, oiled
sizzler platter, and placed on the rack below the broiler’s heat source. Some less-­tender
cuts of meat, such as hanger or flank steak, may also be used if they are cut very thin.
• Select perfectly fresh vegetables for the grill with no softening, discoloration, or wilting.
Once selected, vegetables should be properly rinsed or scrubbed. Remove the peel or skin,
core, and seeds, if appropriate.
• When preparing foods for grilling or broiling, all meat, fish, and vegetables should be of
an even thickness. Very thick cuts of meat or fish may also be butterflied so that the item
may be cooked from start to finish on the grill or in the broiler. Meat should be trimmed of
excess fat and all silverskin and gristle. Some foods are cut into strips, chunks, or cubes
and then threaded onto skewers. Vegetables can be grilled or broiled whole or may be cut
to produce a browned exterior.
• High-­moisture or tender vegetables can be grilled or broiled from the raw state; dense or
starchy vegetables may require preliminary cooking to assure thorough cooking. Among
the vegetables that can be grilled from the raw state are eggplant, zucchini, peppers, and
mushrooms. Vegetables typically parcooked include fennel, sweet potatoes, carrots, and
beets. Prepare the vegetables according to the type and desired result.

386 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

• Season the food and lightly oil very lean items or vegetables. Meat, poultry, fish, soft
vegetables, and precooked hard vegetables may be marinated before grilling or broiling.
Longer marinating (8 to 12 hours) is appropriate for meat and poultry, while shorter
marinating (15 to 30 minutes) is best for fish and vegetables. Longer marinating could
result in the vegetables absorbing too much moisture. If a marinade has been used, it may
be served as a sauce with the cooked vegetables. Marinades for meat, poultry, and fish
should never be reused as a sauce without first bringing it to a boil for an appropriate time
to kill any residual pathogens.
• Maintain grills and broilers carefully. Scour the rods well with a wire grill brush between
grilling different foods, as well as after each service period, to remove any buildup of
charred food particles. Wipe off excess residue with a dry towel. Lightly oil the grill rods
before using the grill. Be careful not to use an excessive amount as it will create excess
smoke and flare-­up, which could be dangerous and create a fire hazard.
• Different parts of the grill or broiler are hotter than others. Divide the grill into zones of
varying heat intensity, including a very hot section for quickly searing foods and cooking
them to a rare doneness, an area of moderate heat for cooking foods to a medium-­rare or
medium doneness, and an area of low heat for slow cooking to a medium-­well or well. Low
heat can also be used to keep foods warm. Zones may also be allocated for different types
of foods, to prevent an undesirable transfer of flavors. Developing a system for placing
foods on the grill or in the broiler, whether by food type or by range of doneness, helps
speed up work on the line.
• Woods such as mesquite, hickory, or apple are frequently used to impart special flavors.
Hardwood chips, herb stems, grapevine trimmings, and other aromatics can be put
in a smoker box (a steel box with holes) or wrapped in aluminum foil, which should be
punctured with a few holes. Either of these methods will allow the smoke to permeate the
grill without allowing the aromatics to ignite.
• Sizzler platters, tongs, offset spatulas, flexible spatulas, and brushes to apply glazes,
marinade, or barbecue sauces should be part of the grill station’s equipment mise en
place, as well as all items necessary for service (heated plates, spoons, or ladles).

crosshatch marks, if desired.
6 Turn the item to complete cooking to the
desired doneness.

3

Turn the food over and continue cooking to the desired doneness. Since most
foods cooked by grilling or broiling are relatively thin and tender, they do not
require much more cooking time once they have been turned over. Thicker
cuts or those that must be cooked to a higher internal temperature may
need to be moved to a cooler portion of the grill or broiler so that they don’t
develop a charred exterior. Another solution is to remove the thicker cuts from
the grill or broiler after they are marked on both sides and finish the cooking
in the oven.
Because many barbecue sauces contain sugar and burn easily, it is
usually a good idea to partially cook the food before applying the sauce, if
using. That way, as the food finishes cooking, the sauce glazes and caramelizes
lightly without burning. A single coat of sauce may be applied to each side of
the food, or to build up a thicker, slightly crusty coat of sauce, the food may be
brushed repeatedly with light coats of sauce.
Remove the meat or fish when it is still slightly underdone, so it does
not end up overcooked by the time it is served. Even thin pieces of meat
or fish will retain some heat, allowing them to cook after they have been
removed from the heat.

PAN GRILLING
Pan grilling involves cooking foods on the stove over
intense heat in a heavy cast-­iron or other warp-­
resistant metal pan with a ridged interior bottom. The
thick ridges create marks similar to a grill and hold
the food up and away from any juices or fat that might
collect. It is important to consider, however, that pan
grilling will not impart the same flavor as will traditional
grilling. Grills and broilers must be well maintained and
kept clean to produce a good-­quality grilled or broiled
entrée. Take the time to prepare the grill before, during,
and after service.

Preserving the Flavor from
Grilled Foods
Because most of the fat and juices that are released
during grilling fall to the coals below, there are generally
no pan drippings from items cooked directly on the grill
grates. For foods that are broiled or grilled in a vessel,
some juices may remain, but they are often charred
by the heating element, making them unusable for
pan sauces.
Be sure to retain any juices that collect as the items
rest. These can be served over the grilled item or added
to a separately prepared sauce or other item.

Quality Criteria for Grilled and Broiled Foods
Properly grilled and broiled foods will:
• have a distinctly smoky flavor that does not overpower the food’s natural flavor.
• have the appearance of grill marks and charring, but should not be so extensive that it
gives the food a bitter or carbonized taste.
• be supported by marinades or glazes, if using, without masking the foods’ natural flavors.
• be tender and moist.

With a sturdy pair of scissors, cut away all fins from the fish and remove all scales. Score the flesh with a knife,
parallel to the rib bones, down to the bone, two or three times on each side of the fish.

2

Season the fish with salt and pepper and rub with the olive oil.

3

On a very hot, freshly cleaned, and oiled grill, cook the fish until cooked through, about 3 minutes on each side, until
the flesh begins to flake upon gentle pressure. Finish in an oven if needed. Larger fish might char too much on the
grill before they cook through. They can be seared on a grill to achieve the flavor and the attractive grill marks and
can then be finished in an oven at 400°F/204°C until the fish is cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F/63°C. The
amount of time will vary depending on the size of the fish. For smaller or very delicate fish, a grilling basket is a useful
tool. It allows to cook and turn multiple fish at the same time without the risk of breaking the fish.

4

After it is done, sprinkle the fish with lemon juice and serve with the tapenade and crusty bread on the side.

More to Know
Barbecuing
Barbecuing, also referred to as smoking, is a grilling technique reserved
for less tender meats with a higher fat content and the heat source
for barbecue is all or partially fueled by wood or other products that
will provide smoke. The product is cooked low and slow (see page 42),
gently infusing it with the flavor of smoke while the tenderizing process
is going on. Some cuts that are ideal for smoking include beef brisket,
pork shoulder, and beef or pork ribs.
The major difference between slow roasting and barbecue is the smoke.
The product needs to be cooked slowly in the 225° to 250°F/107° to
120°C range in a contained environment with the gentle application
of smoke. This can be accomplished in a gas grill, charcoal grill, pit, or
smoker. It is best if the heat is maintained at a constant temperature,
and the smoker opened as little as possible to keep the heat and smoke
in the chamber.
The type of wood used during the smoking process will affect the final
flavor of the meat. It is important to remember that different types
of wood will impart different flavors into the meat, and some woods

The interior of a commercial smoker

may overpower certain cuts of meat. Commonly used woods include
mesquite, cherry, hickory, alder, pecan, and apple.
Dry rubs are ideal for this type of cooking because they season the meat
and provide excellent flavor without burning during cooking. Barbecue
sauces and marinades, while flavorful, tend to contain sugar and other
ingredients that can burn easily. Such sauces should be added at the
end of the cooking process or applied to the finished product or served
on the side.
Many recipes call for excess fat and gristle to be trimmed from meat
prior to cooking. However, it is important not to remove too much fat
from cuts of meat that are to be used for smoking and barbecuing.
The fat present (especially the fat cap on the surface of the meat) will
keep the meat moist during cooking. If too much fat is trimmed from
the meat, the meat will easily dry out over the length of cooking time
required for these methods.
Monitoring the temperature with a dual probe thermometer will help
you avoid opening the smoker. The temperature of the meat should also
be closely monitored. With a probe in the meat, you can monitor the
slow rise in the meat’s temperature and its ultimate doneness.

A hallmark of barbecued meats is their complex, deep flavors. More than in
braising or roasting, barbecue products are highly seasoned. They can be
dry-­cured, brined, rubbed with spices, or marinated before cooking, or basted

Tips of the Trade
• When grilling, be sure to have vessels
at the ready for holding finished items.
Grilling is a cooking technique that
requires supervision.
• After removing items from the grill, resting
on a rack—­as opposed to resting on a

with a full-­flavored sauce during or after cooking. Unlike in braising or roasting,
when barbecuing, the sauce is made separately from the meat, and often
features sweet, spicy, and tart flavors. And of course, the smoke itself is a key
component that contributes to the flavor and texture of the meat.
A smoke ring is a sign of well-­smoked meat. It is created by a buildup of nitric
acid on the surface of the meat, which is then absorbed into the meat. After
cooking, a ring, slightly pink in color, can be found just under the outer crust. It
can range in thickness, but it is generally desired to be 1/4 to 1/2 in/6 to 12 mm.

Q: The grill is flaring up and burning the food.
A: Flare-­ups are typically caused by fat dripping to the heat source below. The
occasional flare-­up may not be a cause for concern, especially on larger items.
But for tender and delicate items, it is best to keep a low-­heat zone available on
any grill so that you can move foods out of flare-­ups to prevent burning. This is
especially important when dealing with marinated or dry-­rubbed ingredients
that may burn quickly when exposed to especially hot flames.

CHAPTER 16

ROASTING
Roasting is a dry-heat technique
that creates tender meat, poultry,
fish, and vegetables with a rich,
caramelized exterior. As a mostly
hands-off method, roasting is an
important skill in the professional
kitchen.

Roasting is a way of cooking by indirect heat in an oven
and typically involves a thin application of fat to the
surface of the item, or the natural skin is left intact to
assist in heat transfer and aid browning. During roasting,
food is enclosed in an oven and surrounded by heat.
In almost all cases, roasting is a balance of time,
temperature, and moisture management. The goal is
to allow time and temperature to do the cooking, and
moisture management to control the browning. Browning
can only occur when natural juices that collect at the
surface of the meat or vegetable evaporate and become
dry enough to allow the natural sugars and proteins to
achieve temperatures for browning.
Roasting commonly refers to cooking large, naturally
tender, multiportion meat cuts, whole poultry, and dressed
fish. It can also be used to cook whole or portion-­sized
vegetables.
• Tender meats from the rib, loin, and leg give the best
results. Trim away any excess fat and silverskin. A layer
of fat or poultry skin helps to baste foods naturally as
they roast.
• Thick-­skinned whole vegetables, such as some root
vegetables, winter squash, and eggplant, are well suited
to roasting or baking. The skins protect the interior
from drying or scorching. Roasting is also excellent
for halved, cut, sliced, or diced vegetables, as well as vegetables that might otherwise be difficult to peel, such as
peppers. Rinse, peel, trim, and cut the vegetable, as necessary. To assure even cooking, cut vegetables into uniform
pieces. Toss the vegetables with oil to promote browning and prevent excessive drying and scorching.
• Items for roasting should be seasoned prior to cooking and may benefit from an extended brine or dry-­rub. For
additional flavor during roasting, fresh herbs or aromatic vegetables may be used to stuff the cavity of birds or fish or
inserted under poultry skin.
• Roasted vegetables are versatile, and they may be served whole, mashed, or puréed. The resulting vegetables can be
served as the main component of a dish, as a side, as a salad or a component of a salad, as a tart or savory pie filling, or
puréed to be used as the base of a soup, stew, or sauce, or even folded into a batter.

412 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

• Whole-­roasted vegetables may be served whole
(or halved), for an appropriate serving size, like in the
example of beets or roasted acorn squash. These whole
preparations may be served as prepared, garnished with
flavoring ingredients like toasted nuts and cheese, or
stuffed with items like grain salads, bread stuffings, or
other vegetable mixtures.
• Portion-­sized cuts may be carved from a whole-­
roasted vegetable, like a “steak” from a whole head of
cauliflower, for example. These cuts might be sauced and
served like traditional animal-­protein presentations, or
even alongside tortillas and toppings as an alternative to
carved-­meat taco preparations.
• The oven should be preheated. There are different
techniques regarding oven temperatures for
roasting. Some items are roasted very quickly at high
temperatures. Others are begun at low temperatures,
then finished at a higher temperature. Still others are
started at a high temperature, then finished at a lower
temperature.
Roast large cuts such as prime rib at a low to medium
temperature throughout roasting. Start smaller or more
delicate foods at a low to medium temperature (300°
to 325°F/149° to 163°C) and then brown them at the
very end of roasting by increasing the oven to 350° to
375°F/177° to 191°C. The longer the roasting time (a factor determined by the type of item,
size and thickness, diameter of the cut, and its density), the lower the temperature of the
oven should be.
• A good roasting pan has relatively low sides to allow hot air to circulate freely. Select a pan
that holds the food comfortably but is not so large that the pan juices scorch. Food to be
roasted may be set on a roasting rack or elevated by aromatics, which permits the hot air
to contact all of the food’s surfaces. The pan should remain uncovered.
• You may need butcher’s twine or skewers, as well as an instant-­read thermometer and a
kitchen fork. Have an additional pan to hold the roasted food while a sauce is made from
the pan drippings. Strainers and skimmers or ladles are needed to prepare the sauce. Have
a carving board and an extremely sharp carving knife nearby for final service.
• Resting plays a key role in carryover cooking, which should be thought of as the last
stage of cooking. When the food is nearly done, remove it from the pan and allow it to rest.
Cover the food loosely with foil to keep it moist and place it in a warm spot to rest. Allow a
resting period of about 5 minutes for small items, 15 to 20 minutes for medium items, and
up to 45 minutes for very large roasts.

chapter 16 • ROASTING | 413

BARDING AND LARDING
If roasts are drastically trimmed, an alternative “skin” should be added in the form of a coating, crust, or solid fat, as
shown in the images below. This process, known as barding, protects delicate meats from the high heat and/or long
duration of the roasting process. Tie the larded roast before cooking to maintain a clean shape.

414 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

Naturally lean meats, like venison and other game meats, may benefit from larding, in which a long needle is used to
weave strips of fat, or lard, throughout the meat to add moisture and fat to the roasting item.

Preserving the Flavor from Roasted Foods
Though the goal of cooking is to enhance flavor, through the process of roasting, flavor may
be left behind in the form of pan drippings or fond. As foods roast, they may release moisture
and fat that settles at the bottom of the roasting pan. Through exposure to high and/or
prolonged heat, these drippings evaporate and reduce, leaving valuable, concentrated flavor
in the pan.
Serve roasted foods with a pan sauce based on the
accumulated drippings from the food. Jus and pan gravy
are the most frequently prepared pan sauces. Onions,
carrots, celery, garlic, or other aromatic vegetables
or herbs added to the pan during roasting will have
browned and roasted in the drippings. They will have a
deep color and will have absorbed some of the flavor
from the drippings, so that they can properly flavor
and color the finished pan sauce. Before preparing any
pan sauce, be sure that the drippings are not scorched.
Scorched drippings result in a bitter, unpalatable sauce.
To make a pan gravy, place the roasting pan on the
stovetop and cook the drippings over medium heat until
the mirepoix is browned and the fat is transparent and
clear. The juices will have separated from the fat and
cooked down to a fond on the bottom of the pan. For a
pan gravy, pour off the fat, but leave enough to prepare
a roux by cooking the fat and some flour together. If
preparing a jus, flour is not used.
After the roux browns, gradually add the stock to the pan
and stir constantly to work out any lumps. Be sure the
liquid is not too hot or it may spatter.
Add the stock and simmer the pan gravy or jus. Cook a
pan gravy until thickened and the flavor has developed,
but for a minimum of 20 minutes to ensure the starch in
the flour is sufficiently cooked.
To prepare a jus, pour off all of the remaining fat and deglaze the pan, if desired, with wine or
another liquid. Add a stock that suits the roasted food. Simmer until the flavor is well developed,
15 to 20 minutes. Skim the jus as it simmers to remove fat and particles from the surface. A jus
may be cooked down until thickened, or to prepare a jus lié, thicken the jus with an arrowroot or
cornstarch slurry just before straining. Use a fine-­mesh sieve to strain the pan gravy or jus into a
clean holding container for storage or into a pan to keep warm for service.

418 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

If not preparing a pan sauce, fat can be strained from the roasting pan and be discarded or
saved for another use, like to sauté vegetables or blend into pâtés; flavorful solids and fond
will remain behind. To release this flavor, deglaze the pan to rehydrate the drippings, which
can be used in other dishes.
It is possible for these drippings to burn during roasting, yielding a burned, bitter fond that must be
discarded. During roasting, add stock, wine, or even water to the roasting pan if the drippings are
evaporating quickly. This will prevent the fond from burning so it can be used later.
Not all roasted foods will produce usable pan drippings or fond, like some low-­moisture
roasted vegetables or lean meats.

Quality Criteria for Roasted Foods
Properly roasted foods will:
• be tender and moist.
• have a deep exterior color, which contributes both flavor and visual appeal.
• have crisp skin, if left on, creating a contrast with the texture of the meat.

Rotisseried foods can be basted while they are

caramelized during cooking.
Smoke-­roasting is an adaptation of roasting that allows
foods to take on a rich, smoky flavor. The food cooks in
a tightly closed environment or in a smoking setup. This
can be done over an open flame or in the oven.
The term baking is often used interchangeably with
roasting; however, it is most typically used in relation to
breads, cakes, pastries, and the like.

430 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

Troubleshooting
Q: Large roasts are cooking unevenly, so one side is drying out while the thicker side is
still cooking.
A: Roasts of inconsistent thickness should be tied to create a uniform shape for even cooking.
This will help them to cook evenly. For some items, like roasted poultry, different fabrications
can help with uneven cooking. For example, removing the spine from a chicken allows it to lay
flat in a roasting dish for a more even distribution of heat. This is called spatchcocking.
Q: The pan drippings are burning while the roast cooks.
A: There is likely not enough moisture in the pan, leading the pan drippings to dehydrate and
burn. During roasting, add meat or poultry broth to the pan and stir to deglaze pan drippings.
Continue to add additional liquid, as needed, until the roast is finished to prevent burning.
Q: Vegetables are dry and shriveled after roasting, making them tough and leathery.
A: Parboil low-­moisture vegetables, like carrots, parsnips, and potatoes, before roasting
for a moist, tender result and appealing appearance. You may also choose to lower the
temperature of your oven, so that the exterior of your ingredients doesn’t dry out before they
are cooked through.

For the filling, in a skillet over medium heat, render the pancetta in the olive oil until crispy, about 5 minutes. Add the
onions and sweat gently until they begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to sweat gently until
fragrant, about 30 seconds.

3

Add the white wine and reduce over medium heat until the wine is completely evaporated and begins to have a
slightly caramelized aroma, about 5 minutes.

4

Add the tomatoes, olives, and thyme and continue to cook over moderate heat until the tomatoes are very soft
and begin to turn into a soft pulp, about 5 minutes. Add the diced squid tentacles and continue to cook for about
30 seconds. Add the scallions and bread crumbs and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.

5

Stuff the squid tubes (heads) about three-­quarters full and secure the opening with a toothpick. Place the stuffed
squid tubes into an oiled ovenproof dish large enough to hold the squid in a single layer, season with salt, and add
white wine until about 1/2 inch/6 mm up the squid. Drizzle the squid with the olive oil and lemon juice, and sprinkle
with bread crumbs.

CHAPTER 17

SAUTÉING
Sautéing cooks food hot and fast,
making it an ideal technique for à
la minute cooking. Useful as a first
step in some other techniques,
like roasting and braising, it is an
important skill to master for use in
any kitchen.

Sautéing is a technique that cooks food rapidly in a little fat over relatively high heat. The
object of sautéing is to produce a flavorful exterior through proper browning, which serves to
intensify the food’s flavor.
Certain menu items listed as seared/pan-­seared, charred/pan-­charred, or pan-­broiled are
essentially sautéed. Sautéed dishes may include a sauce made with the drippings (fond) left
in the pan and are cooked in an à la minute or “just in time” fashion.
• Choose tender cuts for sautés of beef, veal, lamb, pork, and large game animals from
the rib or loin, and some portions of the leg. Poultry and game bird breasts are often
preferred for sautéing, though thighs also withstand the high heat with good results. Firm
or moderately textured fish are easier to sauté than very delicate fish. Shellfish, in and out
of the shell, also sauté well.
• Sautéing can be used with fruits and vegetables, as well as with precooked grains,
pastas, and legumes.
• Rinse, trim, and peel raw vegetables and cut into the desired shape. Thoroughly drain
greens and other vegetables that can hold excess moisture. This important step assures
the best flavor, texture, and color in the finished dish.
• Pound thicker proteins with a mallet or paillard before sautéing, for faster, more even
cooking. It will also mechanically tenderize the protein.
• Some vegetables may benefit from being parcooked by a separate method before being
sautéed. You may partially or wholly cook the vegetable by boiling, steaming, or roasting it
first. Arugula, spinach and other leafy greens, mushrooms, summer squashes, and onions
can be sautéed from the raw state.
• To develop additional flavor, season the item with additional ingredients prior to sautéing,
including marinades, spice rubs, and dried spices. Optional seasonings and aromatics
(salt, pepper, and lemon juice) can adjust or heighten the flavor. Finely mince or chop fresh
herbs and add them at the last moment.
• Select a cooking fat to complement the flavor of the main item. Oils such as olive, peanut,
canola, or corn can be used, as well as clarified butter or rendered animal fat (lard, duck
fat, or bacon).
• A sauté pan (also called a sauteuse) has short, sloped sides and is wider than it is tall to
encourage rapid evaporation. Certain materials are better at conducting heat with quick
reaction to changes in temperature; others offer
a more constant heat and do not react as quickly.
There are benefits to both types of pan, and you
will learn quickly which pan works best in which
situation and with which food.
• Select a pan of the appropriate size. Take the
quantity of food to be sautéed into account when
selecting the pan. It needs to be large enough to
avoid overcrowding; if too much is put in the pan,
the temperature will drop too quickly. On the other
hand, to avoid scorching, the pan must not be
too large. Use offset spatulas, tongs, or stir-­frying
tools to turn and lift foods as they sauté.

444 | ESSENTIAL COOKING TECHNIQUES

Sautéing greens in a stainless-­steel sauté pan

• Dusting the main item with flour is optional and should be done just before adding
the item to the pan. Flour will help to absorb excess moisture and prevent the item from
sticking to the pan, and it will produce a good surface color for light or white meats, poultry,
and fish. If done, be sure to coat the item evenly and shake off any excess. If choosing not
to flour an item, be sure the food is dry before sautéing. Use a paper towel to blot away any
excess moisture.
• Proper doneness depends upon the food itself, safe food handling, and customer
preference. Be sure to allow for some carryover cooking so that foods are not overdone by
the time you are ready to put them on a plate.
• The base for a pan sauce for a sauté may vary to suit the flavor of the main item. Brown
sauces such as demi-­glace or jus lié, veloutés, glace (reduced stocks), vegetable coulis, or
tomato sauce may be used (see more about Sauces in Chapter 14).
• Searing may be a first step for some roasted, braised, or stewed foods; they are
cooked quickly in a small amount of oil over direct heat. The difference between searing
and sautéing is not how the technique is performed, but that those foods are not cooked
completely as a result. Searing is used with those cooking methods as an effective way to
develop flavor and color in conjunction with longer, slower cooking.

Sautéed foods may be served with a pan sauce based on accumulated

other liquid and scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.

PRESERVING THE FLAVOR
FROM SAUTÉED FOODS
Though the goal of cooking is to enhance flavor, through the process of sautéing, flavor
may be left behind in the form of pan drippings or fond. As foods brown, they may release
moisture and fat that settles at the bottom of the pan. Through exposure to high and/or
prolonged heat, these drippings evaporate and reduce, leaving valuable, concentrated flavor
in the pan.
Fat can be strained from the pan and be discarded or saved for another use, like to sauté
vegetables or blend into pâtés; flavorful solids and fond will remain behind. To release this
flavor, deglaze the pan to rehydrate the drippings with stock, wine, or other liquids (see more
about pan sauces on page 358). The drippings will flavor the liquid, resulting in a flavorful
base for a pan sauce or glaze, or as a concentrated enhancement to soups or braises. You
may use the flavorful mixture alongside the sautéed item, or for another dish entirely.
It is possible for these drippings to burn during cooking, yielding a burned, bitter fond
that must be discarded. Not all foods will produce usable pan drippings or fond, like most
vegetables.

Quality Criteria of Sautéed Foods
Properly sautéed foods will:
• have an evenly browned exterior, with meats, poultry, and some fish showing a developed
golden crust.
• be cooked to the appropriate doneness, with a tender and moist interior.
• be well seasoned, with flavors from any accompanying aromatics and finishing ingredients.

Stir-­frying shares many similarities with sautéing. Foods are customarily cut

that are pulled out from the meat due
to salt osmosis. This results in a juicier,
well-­browned, evenly seasoned piece
of protein.
• During service, clean sauté pans are often
held in ovens or under broilers so they are
hot and ready to use.
• For large-­scale production, tilt skillets may
be used to sauté batches of an item. In
this case, the fond is often then added to a
separately prepared sauce.

the dish’s entire flavor.
Typically, a thin-­walled wok is used for a stir-­fry while a sauté pan is used in
the sautéing method. Woks are used to prepare stir-­fries. Pan-­seared and pan-­
broiled items are often prepared in heavy-­gauge pans that retain heat, such as
cast-­iron skillets.

Glazing
When vegetables are fully or partially cooked by steaming, boiling, or roasting,
they can be sautéed just long enough to reheat them or to complete cooking
them—­a technique known as finishing.
Whole butter is a common choice for finishing vegetables,
but other flavorful cooking fats, such as extra-­virgin olive
oil, infused oils, or rendered bacon, are also used to give a
specific flavor to the dish. Vegetables may also be finished
in a small amount of heavy cream or a sauce, usually just
enough to cling to the vegetables.
Glazing is a finishing technique based upon the sautéing
method where a small amount of butter and honey,
sugar, or maple syrup to the vegetable as it reheats in
the pan. The sugars liquefy and may caramelize, coating
the vegetable evenly to give it some flavor, sheen, and a
golden color.
Heat the cooking fat, cream, or sauce over medium to
medium-­high heat. Add sugar, honey, or other syrup to
produce a sweet glaze, if desired. Garnishes may be added
now or after the vegetables are heated through. Add the
prepared vegetables to the pan without crowding and
stir, toss, or turn them until they are very hot and evenly
coated. Taste them for proper doneness and seasoning,
and serve at once.

Troubleshooting
Q: Food is sticking to the pan as it cooks.
A: Food that is being sautéed may appear “stuck” to the
pan if it is not yet ready to be turned. Once an item has
developed a golden brown crust, it should release from
the pan without any effort. If the food does not appear to
be burning or overcooking, it may just need a few more
seconds or minutes.
If food is truly sticking to the pan while sautéing, there
may not be enough oil coating the bottom of the pan.
Oil is necessary to prevent sticking, but also to conduct
heat, so be sure the bottom of the pan is completely
covered in oil.
Sauteing over too-­low heat may also cause an item to
stick to the pan. Monitor the heat and turn it up or back
down as needed.
Q: Mushrooms are cooking through without browning.
A: The pan may be overcrowded. Nearly all foods, but
especially vegetables like mushrooms or zucchini,
contain moisture. When ingredients are packed too
tightly in the pan, the moisture they release becomes
trapped among the pieces of food, rather than
evaporating into the air, which means the food steams
rather than browns. Water may pool in the bottom of

Mushrooms release lots of moisture, so they need plenty of room in the
pan for the steam to evaporate

the pan, indicating that it is not quickly evaporating
as needed.
When this occurs, remove some of the food from the pan and work in batches. There should
be enough room in the pan that the mushrooms, or other items, are in one even layer. The
bottom of the pan should be visible, with space between each ingredient.
Q: What should I do if the pan flares up?
A: In the event of flare-­ups, the key is to stay calm. First, turn off the flame beneath the pan or
pot. Next, smother the flame with the lid of your pot or a clean sheet tray. Depriving the fire of
oxygen is the most reliable way to extinguish a flare-­up in your pan.

2

For the marinade, heat the wine in a 10-­in/25-­cm sauté pan over medium-­low heat, so there are wisps of steam and
very tiny bubbles but it is not simmering. Reduce to 8 fl oz/240 mL, about 45 minutes. Cool at room temperature.

for about 30 seconds. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil with the motor running on the lowest speed. Continue to blend
until thick and emulsified, about 30 seconds more. Stir in the lemon zest.

For the fish, pour 8 fl oz/240 mL marinade into a 2-­gal/7.68-­L zip-­close plastic bag set into a 2-­qt/1.92-­L bowl for
support. Reserve the remaining uncontaminated marinade (about 14 fl oz/420 mL) for the sauce. Place the fish fillets
in the plastic bag, coat with the marinade, and seal. Marinate the fish for 5 minutes.

5

Combine the flour, salt, and pepper in a 2-­qt/1.92-­L shallow bowl. Remove the fish from the plastic bag, allowing the
excess marinade to drip back into bag. Coat 1 fillet at a time with the flour, shaking off any excess. Lay the coated
fish on a parchment-­lined sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining fish, using parchment paper to separate the layers.
Discard all marinade that came into contact with the fish.

6

Heat the oven to 450°F/232°C. In a 12-­in/30-­cm nonstick oven-­safe sauté pan, heat 2 fl oz/60 mL canola oil over
medium heat until the oil is very hot but not smoking. It is hot enough when a small piece of fish causes the oil to
immediately sizzle. Carefully place enough fish into the oil, skin side down, to fill the pan without touching, about
4 pieces. Gently press on the fish so it remains flat in the pan. Adjust the heat so the oil sizzles but does not smoke
or burn. Sear the fish until the skin is golden brown, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes, turn over, add 1 oz/28 g butter to the pan,
and carefully swirl the pan so the butter is evenly distributed. Baste the fish with the butter, then place in the oven.
Roast until evenly browned, the center is opaque and firm, and it reaches an internal temperature of 140°F/60°C,
3 to 4 minutes. Place the cooked fish on a warm platter tented with aluminum foil. Wipe out the pan, discarding the
oil and butter, and repeat with all the fish and the remaining oil and butter.

7

For the Mediterranean sauce, stir the parsley, basil purée, mint purée, and lemon zest into the reserved
uncontaminated marinade and spoon over the fish. The acidity in the marinade oxidizes the herbs very quickly, so
the sauce needs to be finished as close to serving as possible.

CHAPTER 18

PAN FRYING
Meat, poultry, fish, and vegetables
are all rendered crisp and golden
brown through pan frying. Through
practiced temperature control and
timing, pan-fried foods can be moist
and succulent on the interior with a
crunchy coated exterior.

Pan frying is a technique that cooks in enough oil to come about halfway to
two-thirds up its side, over a moderate heat. The object of pan frying is to
produce a flavorful exterior with a crisp, brown crust that acts as a barrier to
retain juices and flavor.
• Pan-­fried food is usually portion-­size or smaller. Select cuts that are
naturally tender, as you would for a sauté. Rib or loin cuts, top round, or
poultry breasts are all good choices. Lean fish, such as sole or flounder, are
also well suited to pan frying.
• Trim away any fat, silverskin, and gristle. Remove the skin and bones of
poultry and fish fillets if necessary or desired. You may want to pound cutlets
for an even thickness and to shorten cooking time. This means that the
exterior will brown without overcooking in the same time that the meat cooks
through.
• All vegetables must be thoroughly rinsed, and in some cases scrubbed.
Trim away tough or inedible skins, peels, cores, seeds, and roots. Cut or slice
as required. Certain vegetables should be parcooked before frying, like firm
root vegetables or other ingredients that may not cook through before the
exterior has crisped and browned.
• Pan-­fried food is often coated—­dredged in flour, coated with batter, or
breaded. Ingredients for breading include flour, milk and/or beaten eggs,
cornmeal, and bread crumbs or cornmeal. For instructions on standard
breading, see page 262.
• The product is cooked more by the oil’s heat than by direct contact with
The key to mastering pan frying lies
in temperature control. Pay careful
attention, and don’t be afraid to adjust
the heat while the food cooks to
maintain a suitable frying temperature.

the pan. In pan frying, the hot oil seals the food’s coated surface, thereby
locking in the natural juices inside.
• The pan and the cooking fat must reach the correct temperature before
the food is added. Otherwise, the crust’s development will be slowed, and it
may never achieve the desired crisp texture and golden brown color.
• The fat for pan frying must be able to reach high temperatures without
breaking down or smoking. Vegetable oils, olive oil (not extra-­virgin), and
shortenings may all be used for pan frying. Lard, goose fat, and other
rendered animal fats have a place in certain regional dishes. The choice of fat
makes a difference in the flavor of the finished dish.
• The fat used in pan frying will break down over time due to heat exposure
and particles and moisture being transferred to the oil from items as they fry.
If the oil begins to foam excessively, or smoke at normal frying temperatures,
carefully discard the oil, carefully clean the frying vessel according to
instructions, and begin with fresh oil. Oil life can be extended by frequent
straining and reducing heat between infrequent batches.
• Select a sautoir, or frying pan with straight edges, for pan frying. The pan
must be large enough to hold food pieces in a single layer without touching.
If the food is crowded, the temperature of the fat will drop quickly and a
good crust will not form. Pans should be made of heavy-­gauge metal and
should be able to transmit heat evenly. The sides should be higher than those
appropriate for sautés, to avoid splashing hot oil out of the pan as food is
added to the oil or turned during cooking.

for determining doneness in pan-­fried foods. In general, the thinner and
more delicate the meat, the more quickly it will cook. Pan-­fried items, like
sautéed and deep-­fried items, even thin pieces, are subject to carryover
cooking. It is thus best to slightly undercook. For more information, review
General Guidelines for Determining Doneness (page 264).
Some foods, because they are thick or include bones or a stuffing, may
need to be removed from the fat and placed in the oven to finish cooking. If
they do need to go into the oven, be sure that they are not covered. A lid could
trap steam to soften the crisp coating.
Drain or blot pan-­fried food on clean paper or cloth towels, or transfer
to a rack set over a baking sheet. The food is ready to serve now. Do not
hold fried foods for more than a very brief period before serving. They tend
to get soggy quickly. Do not cover fried foods if they need to be held for a
short period of time; hold in dry heat on an open rack.

Preserving the Flavor from Pan-­Fried Foods
Because no juices are released and a larger amount of oil is involved, there is generally no
fond or pan drippings resulting from pan-­fried foods. Sauces accompanying pan-­fried foods
are usually made separately.

Quality Criteria for Pan-­Fried Foods
Properly pan-­fried foods will:
• have a crisp, evenly browned exterior.
• be fully covered with well-­adhered coating of breading or batter, when applicable.
• have a tender, moist, and evenly cooked interior.
• not appear oily or soggy.

Seasoned Flour

Egg Wash

Chicken

1

For the seasoned flour, combine all the ingredients in a 2-­qt/1.92-­L shallow bowl. For the egg wash, whisk all the
ingredients in a second 2-­qt/1.92-­L shallow bowl until thoroughly combined. For the pecan flour, combine all the
ingredients in a third 2-­qt/1.92-­L shallow bowl. Line up the bowls in order they were filled for standard breading
procedure.

2

For the chicken, pound the breasts between 2 sheets of waxed paper to an even 1/4-­in/6-­mm thickness. Cut the
chicken into 1 1/2-­in/4-­cm-­wide strips lengthwise. Evenly toss half of the chicken with the seasoned flour in the first
bowl. Lift 1 chicken strip out of the flour, shake off any excess, and dip into the egg wash, letting excess drip back into
the bowl. Press into the pecan flour, patting on to evenly coat. Lay the coated chicken on a parchment-­lined sheet
pan. Repeat with the remaining chicken, using parchment paper to separate the layers.

3

Fill a 16-­in/41-­cm nonstick sautoir with oil so it is about 1 in/3 cm deep. The oil should be deep enough so the chicken
strips float. Warm the oil over medium heat to 350°F/177°C, about 6 minutes. It is hot enough when a small piece
of chicken causes the oil to immediately sizzle but takes about 1 minute to begin browning. The pecan coating is
delicate and will burn if the chicken rests on the bottom of the pan or if the oil is too hot.

4

Carefully place enough chicken strips into the oil to fill the pan without touching. Adjust the heat so the oil sizzles but
does not smoke or burn. Fry the chicken, turning several times, until it is golden brown, the center is opaque and firm,
and it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F/74°C, about 4 minutes.

5

Place the cooked chicken on a cooling rack lined with paper towels. Finish with a sprinkle of salt. Repeat with all the
chicken. Between batches, skim all loose pieces of batter from oil with a fine-­mesh strainer and discard. Replace the
oil as needed to maintain depth. The oil may have to be changed once between batches.

Wondra flour

8 oz

227 g

Kosher salt

1 oz

28 g

Lemon Aïoli

1 Fill a large pot with cold water and 7 oz/200 g of salt. The pot should be large enough to hold all of the artichokes.
2 Trim the stems of the artichokes to within 1 in/2 1/2 cm of the base and about 1/2 in/1.75 cm in from the top. Put them
in the water as soon as they are cut.

3 Prepare an ice bath large enough to hold all the artichokes; it can be more than one ice bath if need be.
4 Bring the water to a boil, and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until the artichokes are tender,
12 to 20 minutes. Test the artichokes by inserting a paring knife through the base of the artichoke and into
the stem; it should go in easily.

5 Remove the artichokes from the water with a spider and place them in the ice bath(s).
6 Once they have cooled, transfer them to a perforated hotel pan set over a regular hotel pan. This should allow the
excess water to drip out from between the leaves. Reserve until needed. Peel off the outer leaves, which are tough
and practically inedible, with your hands. Cut the artichokes in half lengthwise; reserve in an airtight container in
refrigeration during service. Discard after 36 hours.

7 For the aïoli: Chop the garlic very finely on a cutting board with a pinch of the salt. Make a paste with your knife, using
the side of the blade against the cutting board.

8 Place a bowl on a damp cloth towel to anchor it. Place the egg yolks, garlic, vinegar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and
remaining salt in it. Whisk until evenly mixed.

9 Combine both oils, and slowly pour them into the bowl while whisking vigorously to create an emulsion.
10 Reserve in an airtight container with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the aïoli.
11 Heat a fryer with the extra-­virgin olive oil to 355°F/180°C. Have the Wondra flour available in a bowl.
12 When the oil is hot, place 10 cooked artichoke halves in the bowl with the Wondra flour, and toss them to coat
completely in the flour. Shake the excess off each piece in a small sieve. Fry until they have browned evenly and the
leaves are crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.

13 Transfer the artichokes to a bowl lined with a paper towel. Season with salt as needed.
14 Serve immediately, alongside the lemon aïoli.
